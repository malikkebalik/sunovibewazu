The song opens with the acknowledgment that the person in question may have been in the shadows, never receiving any attention, and may have even felt cold there. But despite all this, they were always happy to support the singer and help them shine. The singer realizes that they were the one with all the acclaim but that it was the other person who had all the strength. The other person has a beautiful face and a beautiful smile, but they have always been without a name. They have been hiding their pain behind their smile.</p><br><p>As the song progresses, the singer confesses that they could never have achieved anything without the support of the other person. They are everything the singer wishes to be, and they are the wind beneath the singer's wings. They have allowed the singer to soar higher than an eagle. Although it may have seemed like the singer achieved everything alone, they know that they could never have done it without the other person.</p><br><p>This song is a beautiful tribute to the unsung heroes in our lives. Often, there are people in our lives who are always there to support us, but we don't acknowledge them enough. The song reminds us of the importance of these people and their role in our success. We should take the time to thank them and appreciate their contribution to our lives.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>It must have been cold there in my shadow</u><br>I recognize that you had to sacrifice a lot by staying behind me and not being in the spotlight.</p><br><p><u>To never have sunlight on your face</u><br>You never got to enjoy the attention and recognition that I did.</p><br><p><u>You were content to let me shine, that's your way</u><br>I appreciate how supportive and selfless you were in letting me take the lead.</p><br><p><u>You always walked a step behind</u><br>You were always there for me, providing support and guidance, while staying out of the limelight.</p><br><p><u>So I was the one with all the glory</u><br>I was the one who got all the recognition and credit for our joint efforts.</p><br><p><u>While you were the one with all the strength</u><br>You were the one who gave me the support, strength, and confidence to succeed.</p><br><p><u>A beautiful face without a name for so long</u><br>You had a wonderful personality, but people didn't really know who you were.</p><br><p><u>A beautiful smile to hide the pain</u><br>You tried to remain positive and happy despite all the challenges and difficulties you faced.</p><br><p><u>Did you ever know that you're my hero</u><br>I just want you to know how much I admire, respect, and appreciate you.</p><br><p><u>And everything I would like to be?</u><br>I aspire to be like you, who is kind, generous, and compassionate.</p><br><p><u>I can fly higher than an eagle</u><br>Thanks to your unwavering support and love, I feel like I can achieve anything I set my mind to.</p><br><p><u>For you are the wind beneath my wings</u><br>You are the driving force behind my success and happiness.</p><br><p><u>It might have appeared to go unnoticed</u><br>Your sacrifices and contributions might not have been publicly recognized, but they haven't gone unnoticed by me.</p><br><p><u>But I've got it all here in my heart</u><br>I treasure all the things you've done for me and hold them close to my heart.</p><br><p><u>I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it</u><br>I recognize and acknowledge how much you've done for me, and I am truly grateful for everything.</p><br><p><u>I would be nothing without you</u><br>Without your love, support, and guidance, I wouldn't be where I am today.</p><br><p><u>You're everything I wish I could be</u><br>I look up to you and admire your qualities such as kindness, humility, and selflessness.</p><br><p><u>Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle</u><br>With you as my inspiration and support, I feel like I can accomplish anything and reach new heights.</p><br><p><u>For you are the wind beneath my wings</u><br>You have been there for me through thick and thin, and you continue to lift me up and push me forward.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Peermusic Publishing, Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Jeff Silbar, Larry Henley</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maHufobavq7OhmJyjlafGcKDHnpaQoZ6ZrIOxzZ6YraCPgsago8innqw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
