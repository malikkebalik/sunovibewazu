In this very first look at the new episodes, Q returns — as well as the magical land of Fillory which was only confirmed as a real place towards the end of the first season. Unfortunately, the “magical” part is dying, and it’s up to Quentin and his friends — Alice, Penny, Eliot and Margo — to save it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the trailer we watch as each and every one of our favorite magicians comes into their own. Quentin can be seen running through the woods of Fillory, arrows strapped to his back for safety. Alice (<strong>Olivia Taylor Dudley</strong>) hits the floor as her magic rages through her, turning her eyes white as light shines brightly out of them. And last but certainly not least is Margo (Summer Bishil), who we see summon a massive, terrifying smoke monster towards the end of the trailer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>However, it’s saving magic that is most important — even as we see what appears to be Alice and Quentin taking a shower together and sharing a rather steamy kiss. It looks like Kady (<strong>Jade Tailor</strong>) and Julia (<strong>Stella Maeve</strong>) are not in Fillory with them, either, though that doesn’t keep them safe from you-kn0w-who.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>[interaction id=”5824f6e7ba00a998079fce7c”]</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>For those of you who don’t remember, the first season ended on an extremely upsetting note. Quentin, Alice, Julia, Penny, Eliot and Margo were all left for dead — quite literally — after being attacked by The Beast. Needless to say it didn’t look very good for any of our favorite magicians, so now that we’ve seen a little bit of season two our hopes are a bit higher!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Season two of The Magicians is set to premiere on Monday, January 25 at 9/8c on Syfy. If you missed any of the first season, you can catch up on November 12 when every episode marathons from 9:30am to 11pm ET.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — What do YOU think about the first trailer for the second season of The Magicians?
