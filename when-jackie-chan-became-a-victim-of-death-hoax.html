It also launched Chan into superstardom.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Throughout his decades-long career, Chan has slid down and jumped off buildings and swung on chandeliers resulting in multiple burns, broken bones, and never-ending trips to the ER.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And probably, his brush with such dangerous stunts has spurred rumors of his death time and again.</p><h2>Jackie Chan Addressed the&nbsp;Death Hoax</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 2015, rumors began circulating that Chan had passed away, but the actor, who was very much alive, quashed the rumors.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Rush Hour star took to his official&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;account and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released a statement</a>&nbsp;expressing his shock. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I was shocked by two news reports when I got off the plane. Firstly, don’t worry! I’m still alive. Secondly, don’t believe the scam on Weibo using my name about the Red Pockets. This is my official Facebook page and I only have one official Weibo page. Love you all,” Chan posted on Facebook.</p><p>Oddly enough, this was not the first time the actor was a victim of a death hoax.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2011, fake reports claiming he suffered a fatal heart attack surfaced on social media.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The rumors had his fans in a frenzy, causing the search query “is Jackie Chan still alive?” to trend on Google and Twitter.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But before the death hoax could escalate any further, someone from his team confirmed the actor was alive and working on a new movie.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Washington Post</a>, Courier Mail discovered that the rumor was started by a prank site doctored up to look like the Australian news Web site, Yahoo! 7News.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>What Is Jackie Chan Doing Now?</h2><p>Part of the reason many believed the death hoax&nbsp;could be attributed to Chan’s fewer and fewer appearances in American movies.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Jackie Chan promoting the Foreigner in America.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>The actor was once the busiest in Hollywood, but nowadays, he keeps a low profile.&nbsp;He has gone back to making more Chinese films in recent years, and during an interview with the Portuguese outlet Filmelier in October 2020, he <a href=# rel="follow noopener">revealed</a> why.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He explained he had not retired from Hollywood, but because he was typecast as a police officer in all the movie offers, he had difficulty finding something he wanted to work on.&nbsp;</p><p>“All these years after The Karate Kid, I received so many scripts, but the role is [always] a Hong Kong police officer. That’s why it took me seven years to accept a role in another Hollywood film, with&nbsp;The Foreigner,” Chan explained.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The Foreigner&nbsp;came out after a seven-year gap from his 2010 Karate Kid film.&nbsp;The actor added he wanted his audiences to see a new side of him with every film he starred in.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRmLiqsYycn5qmXZmyosDHZp%2BomahjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
