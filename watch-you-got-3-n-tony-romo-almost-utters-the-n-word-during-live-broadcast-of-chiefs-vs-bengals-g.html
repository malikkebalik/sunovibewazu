Undoubtedly, the games would be monotonous and boring without them. Al Michaels‚Äô antics were previously spotted last year, and now Tony Romeo, a well-known broadcaster, nearly scandalously made news last night.</p><h2><strong>Tony Romo almost utters the N word during live broadcast of Chiefs vs Bengals game, racist slur video goes viral</strong></h2><h4><strong>What did Tony Romo say?</strong></h4><p>The Kansas City Chiefs and the Cincinnati Bengals were two titans in the AFC championship game. Tony, who was covering the game for CBS from the broadcast booth, came dangerously close to making a racial slur. He continued to remark, ‚ÄúRight there, you got three ni‚Ä¶‚Äù throughout the play.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tony Romo: "You got 3 n‚Äî‚Äì"<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">pic.twitter.com/3x1GLta8YQ</a></p><p>‚Äî BLACK ADAM SCHEFTER (@B1ackSchefter) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">January 30, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tony Romo said ‚ÄúYou got 3 n‚Ä¶‚Äù and switched his sentence ü§£ü§£ü§£ what was he bout to say</p><p>‚Äî Shane Leatherbury (@leather__) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">January 30, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>TONY ROMO WAS ABOUT TO SAY 3 NIGGAS ON TV</p><p>‚Äî Van Lathan Jr (@VanLathan) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">January 30, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tony was 5 letters away from getting cancelled üò≠</p><p>‚Äî RELAX üßÄ (@itzzSKL) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">January 30, 2023</a></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The incident happened so swiftly that some observers almost missed the slur as Romo hastily checked himself, but it did occur.</p><h4><strong>Social media is not holding back.</strong></h4><p>No pundit would typically scream the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word on live television, but Romo‚Äôs error has already caused some internet users to scratch their heads. Why on earth would that term even cross the former professional‚Äôs head at that specific moment? He must have been overjoyed.</p><p>Tony developed a sizable fan base throughout his time as a commentator. He has been praised by other media, well-known journalists, and seasoned critics since he is typically regarded as an entertainer. He never would have taken such a drastic and unacceptable move.</p><p>Before working for the TV network, he spent 11 NFL seasons as the Dallas Cowboys‚Äô standout quarterback. He played football and was a four-time Pro Bowler. In 2014, he led the NFL in passing rating. What are your thoughts on Tony Romo‚Äôs erroneous racial slur? Was it a subconscious thought for him?
