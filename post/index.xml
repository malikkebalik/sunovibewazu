Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behindSo I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long A beautiful smile to hide the painDid you ever know that you're my hero</description></item><item><title>Ty Headlee</title><link>/ty-headlee.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ty-headlee.html</guid><description>Ty Headlee estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles &amp;amp; many more details have been updated below.
