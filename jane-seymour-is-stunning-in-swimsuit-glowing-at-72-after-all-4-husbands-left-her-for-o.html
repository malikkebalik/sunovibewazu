Recently, she stunned her fans by posting a snapshot of herself looking radiant in a fashionable swimsuit while reclining on a dried log. The actress smiled from beneath a large hat, sunbathing in peace.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Jane Seymour in "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," 1999 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Seymour looked like she was in seventh heaven as she reclined on the log, looking chic in a pair of stylish sunglasses.

Fans took her message to heart and praised her for looking breathtaking. One social media user gushed, "You are beautiful & timeless." Another <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CtXHAmuP_pO/>wrote</a> with awe, "Looking absolutely gorgeous."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>One person <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CtXHAmuP_pO/>praised</a> the actress, writing, "Truly an#OpenHeartsSunday What an appearance!

Another wrote, "Ya look stunning as usual, Jane!" while another simply commented, "Sexy!!"</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>A day later, she posted another snap of herself. Her latest photo showed her wearing a large sun hat, smiling at the camera. Fans once more went wild, with one <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CtZo3lGJFt3/>writing</a>, "I don't know any celebrity who shows herself without makeup, without filters, just completely natural.

Despite her fame and reputation, the actress has had a tough time finding love in the past. Although she had numerous relationships, each one ended in heartbreak.</p><h3 style=text-align:initial class=ah><strong class=Ug>Although Seymour hasn't found someone to spend her life with, the actress has more than enough loved ones to fill up her life.</strong></h3><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>James Keach and Jane Seymour in New York City on August on 7, 2006 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The 72-year-old actress has been candid about her past relationships and how they've fallen apart, saying it was never her choice to end things. After four marriages, she has learned much about making a relationship work, communicating honestly, and looking at the relationship from a positive perspective if it does start to fray.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Looking back at her own relationships, Seymour has no real idea why things fell apart. She confessed that she had always been a hard-working actress, which meant she wasn't at home as often as she would have liked, but she was the one providing for her husband and children in each relationship.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Jane Seymour, David Flynn, Sean Flynn, Katherine Flynn, and Jennifer Flynn, 1986 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Nonetheless, Seymour's relationships ended badly. Luckily, she has managed to look back at her failed marriages with a smile, even though it is a slightly bemused one. She shared how she always tried to balance her work with being a mother, bringing her kids along whenever she had a lengthy shoot. She <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/jane-seymour-lessons-from-painful-divorces-exclusive/>commented</a> with a laugh:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"I took my kids all over the world whenever I was working, I had them on-set with me.

Seymour admitted that every divorce was painful and left her depressed, but she quickly saw that the best way to move forward was not to stay embittered. She <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/jane-seymour-lessons-from-painful-divorces-exclusive/>shared</a>, "The sooner you can accept it, the better for you and others."</p><h2 style=text-align:center class=_g><strong class=Ug>How Jane Went from Homeless to Head of a Family</strong></h2><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Although Seymour hasn't found someone to spend her life with, the actress has more than enough loved ones to fill up her life.

She had her oldest two, Sean Flynn and Katherine Flynn, with David Flynn. She had twins, Kristopher Keach and John Keach, with her director husband, James Keach.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Although she had her fair share of challenges raising her four children, Seymour wouldn't trade them for anything. Now that she has become a grandmother to three young children, she's reliving the joys of raising little ones all over again.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She adores spending time with her grandkids—Rowan, Willa, and Luna—and often shares posts of her and her three beloved grandkids out on some adventure or just enjoying each other's company at home.

She even looks like her grandmother. However, the doting grandma is just having a blast seeing her grandkids grow up, especially after weathering financial ruin while she was raising her own children.</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Jane Seymour Showed Off Her Twin Sons, Who Are Now Taller than Her: ‘Handsome Men’</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>‘What a Beautiful Couple!’: Jane Seymour Shows Her New Man & Comments on Former Partner of 9 Years</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>'We've Shared Everything from Tears and Triumphs': Jane Seymour Shares TBT Photo with Her Look-Alike Sisters</h2></a><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Seymour has spoken candidly about her divorces in the past, and although they were all heartbreaking, her divorce before starring in "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" was one of the worst.
