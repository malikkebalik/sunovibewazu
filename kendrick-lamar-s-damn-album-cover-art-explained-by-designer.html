He set to go against the grain of what his teachers taught him. “i wanted to make something loud and abrasive,” he explained in a series of tweets on Tuesday (April 11).</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>already seeing a lot of discussion about the cover. and i'm really excited about it. it's interesting to see people talk about "bad" design.</p><p>— Vlad Sepetov (@VSepetov) <a href=#>April 11, 2017</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>and maybe some won't see that, but i'm glad that dave and dot saw the value in making something that didn't fit the mold.</p><p>— Vlad Sepetov (@VSepetov) <a href=#>April 11, 2017</a></p><p>Sepetov has a lot to be proud about. He was one of the creative minds behind the artwork of Kendrick’s last album, <a href=#>To Pimp A Butterfly</a>, which was set in a time where the black revolution saw a West Coast-style turn up on the White House lawn. The depiction set against a monochrome, black-and-white vintage Polaroid was artsy enough to spark discussions of meaning and how it went perfectly with the theme of Dot’s 2014 album.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>just given the bare bones we fleshed something out that has a lot of people talking. it's not uber political like tpab but it has energy imo</p><p>— Vlad Sepetov (@VSepetov) <a href=#>April 11, 2017</a></p><p>DAMN. brings out a different emotion with the parental advisory sticker as a bold, prominent fixture.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@NickyChulo</a> we wanted to make the pa logo part of the design not an afterthought. why make it small? let's make it huge and embrace it. DAMN.</p><p>— Vlad Sepetov (@VSepetov) <a href=#>April 11, 2017</a></p><p>This doesn’t mean that it was safe from becoming <a href=#>an amusing meme</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Regardless if the people are feeling the DAMN. artwork or not, the project drops on Friday (April 14) with features from U2, Rihanna and Zacari, while production is being handled by Teddy Walton, Mike WiLL Made-It, &nbsp;The Alchemist and 9th Wonder among others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZkaH12fY6toK2klWO4prrDq6Cco12hrq6t0axknZmdo3qovsCpn6KbXZmytLXGp5yrZZSas6a6w6xkmqSSqrpurdGtrqiqmw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
