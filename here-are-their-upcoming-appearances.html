For over two months, the romantic comedy K-drama was the highlight of our week and something we looked forward to watching after a long day. Something about this show keeps us coming back for more, whether it’s the easygoing plot, the amusing characters, or the LSS-inducing original soundtrack. The truth is that, however many months have passed, we have not come down from our Business Proposal high. Is it you, by any chance? With that in mind, we know you’re anxious to learn about the cast’s current and future endeavors. And so as here we will discuss about business proposal cast and many other things related to him.</p><h2 id=business-proposal-cast class=rb-heading-index-0>Business Proposal Cast</h2><h3 id=1-kim-sejeong-as-shin-ha-ri class=rb-heading-index-1>1. Kim Sejeong as Shin Ha Ri</h3><p style=text-align:justify>In case you haven’t noticed, Kim Sejeong recently got a haircut. After wrapping up filming on Business Proposal, she took a trip to Jeju Island with her best friend, Jihyo of TWICE, before jetting out to Europe. Sejeong has returned to South Korea, where she’ll join Nam Yoon Su, Choi Daniel, and HIGHLIGHT’s Dongwoon in the upcoming drama Today’s Webtoon.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The drama, which stars <a href=# rel=noopener>Sejeong</a> as Oh Ma Eum, an Olympian-turned-webtoon editor, is an adaptation of the Japanese series Sleeper Hit!, which aired in 2016.

Ahn Hyo Seop as Kang Tae Moo</h3><p style=text-align:justify>We are not only awed by Ahn Hyo Seop’s acting abilities but also by his runway walks. Recently, he walked the runway at Ewha Womans University for the Dior Fall 2022 collection. He is also currently an endorser for a few high-end labels.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His next project is: A Time Called You, a Netflix Drama.

Seol In Ah as Jin Young Seo</h3><p style=text-align:justify>Seol In Ah has switched agencies in the same way as Hyo Seop did. GOLD MEDALIST Entertainment, run by Kim Soo Hyun, has signed her. In April, In Ah appeared on the reality show I Live Alone to discuss her experiences living alone (spoiler alert: there’s a lot of skating and a cute dog!). She also became an endorser for the British fashion house Burberry that month. Ah’s next film is the love film Nikang Nikang, so keep an eye out for her. Production began last year, but there has been no word on when we may expect to see the finished product.

Kim Min Kyu as Cha Sung Hoon</h3><p style=text-align:justify>Kim Min Kyu is our newest A-list variety show performer. The 27-year-old recently appeared on the MBC show The Manager, during which he discussed his fitness routine, love-hate connection with spicy cuisine, and endearing interactions with his manager. Watch Min Kyu as…a high priest named Rembrary in the upcoming fantasy drama High Priest Rembrary. The deal? His body transformed into that of a K-pop star overnight. That’s cool, isn’t it? Early in the new year, High Priest Rembrary will supposedly premiere.
