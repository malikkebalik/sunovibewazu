They wanted to switch things up and go with someone new and someone who hasn’t been in the spotlight yet.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>In an interview with Good Morning America in November 2021, Clayton confirmed that he found love on The Bachelor season 26. “I did find love, and I was a little skeptical going into the whole journey but I’m so pleasantly surprised that things worked out much different than what I had thought,” he said. “I’m just so excited to watch it back and have everyone else watch it as well.” Clayton also told Good Morning America that came into The Bachelor with a “checklist of sorts” but but the women surprised him when “they brought all of that and so much more.”</p><p>So who is <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bachelor 2022 winner</a> for Clayton’s season and is he engaged and still together with the woman who received his Final Rose? Read on for what we know about The Bachelor 2022 winner so far and who wins season 26. (For more <a href=# rel=noopener>Bachelor 2022 spoilers</a>, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.)</p><h2>Who is The Bachelor 2022 winner?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Susie-The-Bachelor.jpg><p>Who is The Bachelor 2022 winner? Reality Steve confirmed that the winner of The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard is Susie Evans, a 28-year-old wedding videographer from Virginia Beach, Virginia, however, she rejects Clayton in the end. According to Reality Steve, Susie was eliminated in third place during Fantasy Suites after Clayton told her that he was in love and had sex with his other two finalists—Rachel Recchia, a 25-year-old flight instructor from Clermont, Florida, had the first, and Gabby Windey, a 30-year-old ICU nurse from Denver, Colorado—and Susie questioned how he could be serious about their relationship when he was intimate with someone else. The fight escalates, and Clayton decides to eliminate Susie after she tells him how she doesn’t know if she can stay on the show if he’s in love with other women.</p><p>At the final three Rose Ceremony with Rachel and Gabby, Clayton tells both Rachel and Gabby that he’s in love and had sex with both of them. Both Rachel and Gabby walk away and try to leave the show, which leads Clayton to beg them to stay. Both Rachel and Gabby agree to stay and Clayton gives them both roses. The finale continues with Gabby and Rachel meeting Clayton’s parents. After Gabby and Rachel’s meeting with Clayton’s parents, Clayton realizes that he still has feelings for Susie and decides to talk to her. Host Jesse Palmer knocks on Susie’s door and tells her that Clayton wants to talk to her. Susie agrees and she and Clayton reunite. Susie then also meets Clayton’s parents, after which he decides he wants to choose her at the Final Rose Ceremony and eliminate Rachel and Gabby. Clayton tells Rachel and Gabby about his decision separately in their hotel rooms. Rachel was more sad, while Gabby was more angry at Clayton. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Clayton arrives with an engagement ring and a plan to propose to Susie, but before he can do so, Susie tells Clayton that she’s not in love with him and walks away, which forces Clayton to leave The Bachelor single.</p><p>Reality Steve also reported that Clayton’s relationships with Rachel and Gabby ended once he eliminated with them, and there’s no hope for them to get back together after he was rejected by Susie. “There is zero chance he is rekindling anything with Gabby or Rachel. They have nothing to do with anything since they left Iceland,” Reality Steve wrote.&nbsp;<span>“I don’t think anyone expected it to end the way that it did, including myself, nor did I want it to be that way. There was a lot of things that I just never would’ve thought would’ve happened the way they did. So everyone will be kind of surprised. I wish it could have went any other direction, but it went the direction that it did. Ultimately, I had to react accordingly,” Clayton said of how his </span>Bachelor<span> season ended on the Women Tell All.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Though Reality Steve couldn’t confirm Clayton and Susie’s relationship, he reported that it’s unlikely they’re back together.&nbsp;Reality Steve also reported that both Susie and Gabby are frontrunner to be the season 19 Bachelorette, which starts filming in late-March. Of the two, Reality Steve believes that Gabby is the more likely choice.</p><p>Reality Steve’s spoilers come after a Reddit post by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@workingbach13</a> in December 2021 theorized that the final two were Susie or Rachel. The post suspected this because Susie and Rachel both followed Cary Fetman on Instagram. Cary is the Bachelor franchise’s stylist and costume designer who often styles the lead and the last two contestants for the Final Rose Ceremony.</p><p>The post speculated that Susie could’ve won Clayton’s Bachelor season because she was the first of the final three Bachelor contestants to return to social media, which has been consistent with past Bachelor and Bachelorette winners. Susie’s family and friends also follow Clayton on Instagram. A fan account has also posted an alleged screenshot of Susie commenting heart eye emojis on one of Clayton’s recent Instagram photos, which he liked. Susie also received the Pretty Woman date—a.k.a. a date where the lead and the contestant go on a shopping spree—in Vienna, Austria, in week seven, which has been indicative of other Bachelor and Bachelorette winners who have had similar dates, such as Rachel Kirkconnell from The Bachelor season 25 with Matt James; Hannah Ann Sluss from The Bachelor season 24 with Peter Weber; Becca Kufrin from The Bachelor season 22 with Arie Luyendyk Jr.; and Bryan Abasolo from The Bachelorette season 13 with Rachel Lindsay. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a> also hinted in a tweet in November 2021 that there’s evidence that Susie won Clayton’s Bachelor season. “Do I post pics of Susie from Clayton’s season out last night so the subsequent dissection of the pics, freak out, and speculation from the fans can commence?” he tweeted.</p><p class=p3>The post, however, also speculated that Rachel could’ve won Clayton’s Bachelor season because she returned to social media at the exact time Clayton did. Rachel’s mom also followed Clayton on Instagram but unfollowed him when filming ended. Rachel Clayton also both liked the same Instagram photo of The Bachelor host Jesse Palmer 20 minutes after it was posted, even though Rachel doesn’t follow Jesse on Instagram. Rachel was also the only contestant from Clayton’s final three that liked season 18 Bachelorette Michelle Young’s first photo with her winner, Nayte Olukoya, which Clayton also liked.</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed in February 2022 that Clayton does not have a traditional ending, there was no finality to his Bachelor season. Reality Steve also reported that Clayton didn’t have a traditional “Final Rose Ceremony” with two women, where he picks out a ring, one woman arrives and is eliminated and the other woman arrives and he proposes to them. Reality Steve also reported that he didn’t have any “Happy Couple” visits (a.k.a. when the Bachelor and their winner have a secret weekend together) the whole season.</p><p>For Clayton’s proposal to Susie, it’s almost certain that the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple to stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><h2>Who is Susie from The Bachelor 2022?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Susie-E-The-Bachelor-2022.jpeg alt='Susie E., "The Bachelor 2022"' width=410 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Susie Evans is a 28-year-old wedding videographer from Virginia Beach, Virginia.

In her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bachelor bio</a>, Gabby described her dream man as someone who has a “quiet confidence.” “Gabby is much more than meets the eye. Not only is she beautiful, but she also has a lot of substance, emotional depth and a wealth of lived experiences,” her bio read. “Gabby is looking for a man with quiet confidence. She doesn’t have a physical type but says that if he doesn’t have a personality, then it’s a hard pass. Her ideal man will challenge her, communicate his feelings and work hard to equally carry the weight of the relationship.”</p><p>Her bio continued, “The one nonnegotiable for Gabby? Whatever man captures Gabby’s heart must also have room in their life for her four-legged friend because she and her goldendoodle Leonardo are a package deal. While Gabby would love to find a man, she isn’t the type to lose herself in a relationship. She’s hoping to find a man who will love her for the independent woman she is.”</p><p>For her fun facts, Gabby listed the following:</p><p>• Gabby is terrified of humpback whales but would love to see one in person from a safe distance.</p><p>• Gabby loves to write cards.</p><p>• Stomping grapes in Italy is at the top of Gabby’s bucket list.</p><p>Clayton also isn’t Gabby’s first Bachelor Nation relationship.&nbsp;Gabby is the ex-girlfriend of both Dean Unglert from The Bachelorette season 13 with Rachel Lindsay and Blake Horstmann from The Bachelorette season 14 with Becca Kufrin. Dean, who also starred on Bachelor in Paradise season 5 and 6, confirmed the relationship on an episode of his “Help! I Suck at Dating” podcast in October 2021. “She was, like, one of the main exes. She was my girlfriend from college,” he said. “Producers called me and were like, ‘Hey, we’re thinking of casting this person — what do you think of her? We know that you dated 10 years ago.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, she’s great. If she gets selected for the show, she’ll either win the show or she’ll be the next Bachelorette.’ And I firmly believe that.”</p><p>Blake, who was also on Bachelor in Paradise season 6, also confirmed that he dated Gabby for a “couple months” on an episode of the “Behind the Rose” podcast in October 2021. “We like the same girls, man. I didn’t know Dean until obviously, like, 2018, but Gabby was a good friend of one of my very good friends from college, they were roommates,” he said. “I met Gabby long before I was on The Bachelorette, like, I want to say maybe 2015 or 2016. We hung out for a little bit, so I know her very well. And Dean, I don’t know how it came up, but one time, me and Dean were sitting there — I think we were in Buffalo, and he mentioned Gabby — and I was like, ‘How do you know Gabby?’ And he was like, ‘Dude, she was, like, my girl in college, you know, we were in love and blah blah.’”</p><p>He continued, “She’s fun. She has a very outgoing personality, very loud, like, when she walks into a room, you know she’s in a room. You never know if the lead is going to be into something like that. You never know if they like the more shy, quiet type or they like the loud, outgoing type, but she’s definitely very loud, very outgoing, she has a lot of friends. So if Clayton’s into that, I see her getting hometowns, for sure. She’s a beautiful woman. … They’re gonna have the football player, cheerleader story line.”</p><p>In an interview on the “Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation” podcast in January 2022, Gabby claimed that she and Blake “hung out for a little” but weren’t ever in an official relationship. “Blake and I had mutual friends,” Gabby said, noting that they met after she graduated from college in 2014.&nbsp;“We never actually went on a date. There was no drinks paid for. No dinner paid for. [Blake’s] saying we dated… He’s definitely friends of friends. You know, we had spent time together and stuff but definitely no, like, official dating, like, no really kind of formal, no exclusivity and again, it was a really long time ago.”</p><p>She called Dean, however, one of her “first loves.”&nbsp;“It was just so long ago,” she said. “It’s a distant past from my experience on ‘The Bachelor’ and you know, Clayton [Echard] and I’s story, it’s very much its own thing. I’m always really grateful that it was so far in the past, so I could focus more on Clayton and kind of separate [that].”</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1><b>Who is The Bachelor 2022, Clayton Echard?&nbsp;</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gabby-W-The-Bachelor-2022.jpeg><p class=p3>In case you didn’t know: Clayton Echard is The Bachelor 2022.
