Today, our hearts collectively break as we grapple with the profound loss of a man who dedicated over two decades of his life to the Southside Baseball Club (SSBC). Coach Trask’s loyalty and infectious enthusiasm were not just attributes; they were integral threads woven into the very fabric of SSBC.</p><p>For more than 20 years, he played a pivotal role in shaping the club into the vibrant, educational haven for aspiring ballplayers that it is today.&nbsp; His impact reached far beyond the field, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of all those fortunate enough to have been mentored by him. As we confront this painful reality, our thoughts and prayers are with his grieving family—his wife Kathy and daughter Bailey. In the face of an unimaginable loss, we extend our deepest condolences, hoping they find strength and solace as they navigate the challenging path forward without their beloved husband and father.</p><p>Coach Trask’s influence extended well beyond the realm of sports. He was a mentor, a role model, and a source of inspiration for countless young ballplayers whose lives he touched. The lessons he imparted, both on and off the field, will continue to resonate in the hearts of those who had the privilege of learning from him. Each time a player steps up to the plate, Coach Trask’s legacy will be palpable—a testament to the enduring impact of a man whose passion for the game and dedication to his players knew no bounds.</p><p>In this time of sorrow, the Southside Baseball Club stands united, remembering Coach Trask not only for his contributions to the sport but for the positive influence he had on the lives of those he encountered. As we grieve together, we find solace in the knowledge that his legacy will live on, echoing through the cheers of young ballplayers and the fond memories shared by a community forever grateful for the time they spent with Coach Jason Trask.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwtsCspqdlpKeutLeMqJmirKWWv7p5wqGcq6GjnbKlecyepJudomK8p3nSqKytoF2otbC%2BxGaZmquVl66tuIyco66aXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
