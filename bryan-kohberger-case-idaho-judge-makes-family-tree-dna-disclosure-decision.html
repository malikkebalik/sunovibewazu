The exact extent of the disclosure remains uncertain due to a gag order and the sealing of specific details. However, Judge John Judge emphasized the importance of protecting the privacy of the investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) information, including individuals on the family tree.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Extent_of_Discovery_Disclosure_Unclear></span>Extent of Discovery Disclosure Unclear<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While the judge’s decision mandates the sharing of a portion of the genetic genealogy evidence, the precise scope of this disclosure remains shrouded in secrecy. The sealed order aims to safeguard the privacy of the IGG information, ensuring that sensitive details about the family tree and related individuals are not exposed. This cautious approach underscores the need to balance the pursuit of justice with the protection of personal privacy.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sealed_Order_to_Protect_Privacy_of_Investigative_Genetic_Genealogy_Information></span>Sealed Order to Protect Privacy of Investigative Genetic Genealogy Information<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>To safeguard the privacy of the investigative genetic genealogy information, Judge John Judge has issued a sealed order outlining the specific material to be provided to Bryan Kohberger’s defense team. This measure ensures that the sensitive details of the IGG investigation, including the identities of individuals on the family tree, are not compromised. By prioritizing the protection of privacy, the court aims to maintain the integrity of the legal process while respecting the rights of all parties involved.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Prosecutors_Argument_and_Police_Findings></span>Prosecutors’ Argument and Police Findings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the Bryan Kohberger investigation, prosecutors put forth an argument regarding the use of investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) evidence by the police.
