Look for models with a safety switch that only toggles the flash once the device touches your skin.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prioritize ones that come with a pair of safety goggles and have some sort of third-party certification to their name. You can also browse through some customer reviews to get a better idea about your permanent hair remover's safety features.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Compatibility</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Your new at-home hair remover must also be compatible with your skin and hair type. To promote best buying practices, look for models that come with adjustable intensity settings to cater to maximum categories.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To enhance your buyer’s knowledge, you can also take a look through some customer testimonials. Past buyer experiences can inform you of the pros and cons of your new device, and when it comes to major flaws this exposure can save you from purchasing a subpar product!</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>The Average Cost of Permanent Hair Removers</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>As far as the dollar signs go, you can expect to pay anywhere between $70-$120 for a new IPL-equipped permanent hair removal solution. Generally speaking, higher-priced models will be equipped with more power and adjustability settings.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To add to this, they will probably have some sort of third-party certification to their name.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Buying Tips</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here are two killer tips to help you make a more informed choice when selecting a new permanent hair remover for yourself:</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Ergonomics</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's no good owning a hair-removing device that is a hassle to hold or operate. This is why we recommend only opting for ones with an ergonomic shape and design. You can get a better idea of how to hold or use your new gadget by going through some customer reviews.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Effectiveness</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Every brand in this market will push forth its product as being the most effective. What you need to ensure is that the product is </span><span style=font-weight:400>actually effective</span><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To promote best buyer practices, avoid brands that boast of quality yet have a low customer rating. Another red flag is a brand that has no customer reviews.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>How Did We Shortlist Our Favorite Permanent Hair Removers?</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here are some factors we kept in mind while curating our list:</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Versatility</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Buying a separate hair remover for different body parts is a hassle. Let's not forget how it isn't exactly easy on the pocket either. This is why we made sure to only shortlist models that were versatile enough to be used all over the body by simply toggling between modes.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Longevity</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>As far as longevity factors went, we prefer devices that came with some sort of warranty package. We also made sure to only select IPL hair removers that were well-made and didn't require you to replace their epilation cartridges.</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>Are permanent at-home hair removers worth buying?<p><span style=font-weight:400>An at-home permanent hair-removing solution is extremely cheap when compared to a laser treatment at the salon. Also, unlike these salon sessions, this device isn't an exclusive one-time thing. Quality permanent hair removers can last you decades, and once you buy one you can even share them with your loved ones.</span></p>Does permanent hair removal last?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Permanent hair removing devices can offer near-permanent results. Even if your hair grows back after some time, its thickness will be significantly reduced. This makes it a perfect option for those who are always on the go, as well as those who travel for extended periods of time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, if you’ve guided your permanent hair remover over an incorrect area know that the hair will eventually grow back!</span></p>Are IPL hair removers painful?<p><span style=font-weight:400>The light-based permanent hair removal technique of IPL is extremely safe and painless. The treatment itself doesn't sting, and even if any side effects develop on the skin they'll usually go away after a few hours or days.</span></p>Can I share my IPL hair remover with a family member?<p><span style=font-weight:400>While it is always best to use your own device, you can technically share your hair remover so as long as you clean it with an alcohol-based cleanser after each use.</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
