What is more, Tito is a successful businessman, who owns the “Punishment Training Center” and “Punishment Athletics”. During his career Ortiz has gained various titles and awards; some of the achievements include Most Fights in UFC History, Second Most Successful Light Heavyweight Title Defense in UFC History, Fight of the Night, UFC 13 Light Heavyweight Tournament Runner-Up, among many others. Tito was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame. Undoubtedly, Tito is one of the most successful mixed martial artists.</p><p>If you consider how rich Tito Ortiz is, it can be said that Tito’s net worth as estimated by authoritative sources is over $20 million, having mainly gained this sum of money through his career as a mixed martial artist which spanned 1997 to 2017. Activities related to this sport have also added a lot to Tito’s net worth. In addition, Ortiz has appeared in several movies which has also increased his net worth somewhat.</p><h3>Tito Ortiz Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Tito’s childhood and teenage years were quite problematic, as he spent a lot of time with street gangs, and his parents were addicted to drugs, so Ortiz had to work from a very young age in order to support himself. When he started attending Huntington Beach High School, Tito became interested in wrestling and soon his talent was noticed by others. Despite his talent, Ortiz stopped training for some time and again had to work at various jobs. After some time Tito started studying at the Golden West College, later transferring to California State University at Bakersfield.</p><p>Tito’s career as a mixed martial artist began in 1997, and it soon became the main source of his net worth. In 1999 Tito participated in the “UFC 22” championship, and although his performance was not very successful it helped him to gain more experience and improve his skills, such that a year later he was able to win the title of Light Heavyweight Champion; this had a huge impact on the growth of Tito’s net worth. Tito continued participating in various championships and showing good results. In 2014 Ortiz participated in another championship, called “Bellator 120” and continued participating in these championships in order to achieve the title of the Bellator Light Heavyweight Champion.</p><p>Despite this fact, Tito decided to focus more on his business activities and his own companies, and retired in 2017 after a total of 32 fights.&nbsp; Tito is also known for his appearances in such movies as “Zombie Strippers”, “The Crow: Wicked Prayer”, “Cradle 2 the Grave” and others. These appearances also increased Tito Ortiz’s net worth, so it’s clear that Tito is still a very active and hardworking person.</p><p>To talk about Tito’s personal life, it can be said that he was married to Kristin from 2000 to 2005, and they have one child. Later Ortiz had a relationship with <a href=#>Jenna Jameson</a> and they have two children. Now Ortiz is dating Amber Nichole Miller. Tito had some problems with the law as he was accused of domestic violence in 2010. He also had a run-in with the law in 2014, being charged with DUI, and sentenced to three years probation, and attendance at an alcohol rehabilitation program. He and family are still based in Huntington Beach.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.876014760148><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tito Ortiz</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 23, 1975</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Huntington Beach, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>206 lbs (93.4 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Mixed Martial Artist, Coach, Actor, , Businessman, CEO, Owner of Punishment Athletics MMA</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Golden West College, California State University, Bakersfield</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Abi Lewis</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Journey Jette Ortiz, Jesse Jameson Ortiz, Jacob Ortiz</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Sam Ortiz</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nicknames</td><td>Jacob Ortiz , Jacob Christopher "Tito" Ortiz , Jacob Christopher Ortiz , The Huntington Beach Bad Boy , The People's Champ , The Lions Den Hunter</td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Tito-Ortiz-227273766134/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/titoortiz</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32727272727273><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/titoortiz1999/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0651274</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Awards</td><td>ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship, UFC Light Heavyweight Championship (2000-2003), 2000 ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championships (99 kg, Bronze Medalist), CCCAA State Champion (1995, 1996)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>UFC Hall of Fame (2012), MMA Freak Hall of Fame Class of 2013, CIF All-State Selection (1993), CCCAA All-State Selection, Mixed Martial Arts Hall of Fame</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>The Crow: Wicked Prayer, Zombie Strippers (2008), Valley of the Wolves: Iraq</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Hell's Kitchen, CSI: NY (2012), Cradle 2 the Grave (2003), Unrivaled: Tito Ortiz (TV Movie 2014)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=8.3685567010309><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=1.2><td>1</td><td>I am the <a href=#>Muhammad Ali</a> of MMA.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>2</td><td>Believe in your goals.
