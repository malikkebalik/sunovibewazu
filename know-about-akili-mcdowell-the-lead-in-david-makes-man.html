The show is&nbsp;centered around the titular character David, played by young actor Akili McDowell. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Described by <a href=# rel=follow>Oprah Winfrey</a> as "poetry on television," the show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">follows</a> the story of an African-American teenager who tries to make it into the high school of his dreams while dealing with poverty and the death of his close mentor.&nbsp;</p><h2>He Wanted to Be an Actor at 8</h2><p>The actor, who&nbsp;graduated high school in 2021, first picked up the acting bug when he was just eight years old. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During an interview with the In Creative Company, McDowell <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that he first thought about becoming an actor when he saw Kyle Massey portray Cory Baxter, Raven's brother in the Disney show&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>That's So Raven.</p><p>The way he brought his character to life and has so much personality and in his character I could see a lot of myself.&nbsp;</p><h2>He Has a Lot in Common with His Character</h2><p>Since he was just an eight-year-old nagging his mother about how he wanted to be like the guy on TV, she had a hard time believing him.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Still, after a lot of pleading, the actor claimed that his mother realized that his passion and commitment were undeniable even at such a young age. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the same interview, he also suggested that he had a lot in common with his character David. Be it the fact that both of them were raised by a single mother or the fact that they want to always be there for their family, the connection between the two was real.&nbsp;</p><p>So, even when McDowell was simply acting out his part in David, he confessed he had learned a lot from that character that applied beyond the reel life.&nbsp;</p><h2>His Height, Weight, and Age</h2><p>Hailing from Huston, Texas, McDowell's other extracurricular interests include playing football. In fact, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played</a>&nbsp;for his home team North Shore Mustangs, and even boasts a NextGen All America Camp badge on his player&nbsp;profile.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Other details in his profile include his height, which is five-foot-four, his weight which was 135 pounds, and his birth year: 2002, which puts him at 19 years old as of 2021.</p><p>As per his profile, he was&nbsp;enrolled in North Shore Senior High School and had&nbsp;a GPA of 2.9.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Fresh Out of High School</h2><p>McDowell recently took to his Instagram to announce his high school graduation to the world. The post featured a series of snaps of The Astronaut&nbsp;Wives Club&nbsp;star posing in red academic regalia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the caption, the actor encouraged all those who read it to make sure to complete high school when they were ready and cherish every moment spent doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>"Iâ€™m officially done with with Highschool," he concluded,&nbsp;"On to the next chapter..."</p><p>Even though he is fresh out of high school, his acting portfolio already has 10 credits on his IMDb <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">page</a>. He is best known for his roles in&nbsp;The Astronaut&nbsp;Wives Club, Billions, and obviously,&nbsp;David Makes Man. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a4qrjIZqScnJ%2Bssq24jJ2Yr6GUYrqit8SsZKaZnmKuqLGMoZyin5ipe6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
