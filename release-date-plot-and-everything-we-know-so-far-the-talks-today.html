On 7th June, the producer behind the Joaquin Phoenix- blockbuster, Todd Phillips, shared a first look at the second part’s official script on his Instagram. The sequel film will see continued collaboration between the writers Phillips and Scott Silver, who initially collaborated to make the screenplay for the Oscar-winning original “Joker” film.</p><p>Besides announcing the highly anticipated project, Phillips likewise posted an image of Phoenix somewhere down in thought, apparently reading the script, implying that he will reprise his role as the main protagonist in the sequel.</p><p>The Joker is one of the most enduring and noteworthy characters in comics, TV, and film. He’s been played many times by iconic stars like Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, and Heath Ledger. One more entertainer to twist the person to a brilliant, Oscar-winning result was Joaquin Phoenix in 2019’s unexpected hit Joker.</p><h3><strong>Joker 2 title: Folie à Deux What Does It Means?</strong></h3><p>Folie à deux is the French expression for a ‘shared psychosis’, referring to a “delusion or mental illness shared by two individuals in close association” and is used generally in English, as well, to describe this specific sort of mental illness.</p><p>Once more from the title, we can foresee that Arthur Fleck’s fractured psyche will be investigated on-screen, however, it might likewise imply that a second hero will become an integral factor as a real second individual with whom Joker shares his plans.</p><h3><strong>Joker 2 Release Date</strong></h3><p>Rumours of Joker 2 began doing the rounds as soon as 2019, and in May 2021, The Hollywood Reporter claimed Phillips had signed on to write a sequel for the film.</p><p>Warner Bros. has a packed slate of DC films on the way, including Black Adam to The Flash taking us a long way past 2023. Phillips posted a shot of Phoenix reading the script on Instagram, confirming that basically the story is done.</p><p>In any case, Joker: Folie à Deux hasn’t entered creation which implies we could be in for a bit of wait. Of course, Joker was shot in only 12 weeks and had speedy-post production after creation due to no extra CGI.</p><p>There is no official release date for Joker 2 yet, yet the director has uncovered the project is underway. In light of the release date of the first Joker film, which landed a year after the script had been written, fans can anticipate that Joker 2 should land at some point in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Cast</strong></h3><p>Joaquin Phoenix will be back as Arthur Fleck, otherwise known as Arthur Fleck. Given his performance won him an Oscar for Best Ac tor, it’s nothing unexpected Warner Bros might want to strike gold two times. Besides Phoenix, no other cast individuals have been confirmed at this point.</p><p>Lady Gaga is in talks to play Harley Quinn in the second Joker film, as per The Hollywood Reporter, which is supposedly going to be a musical.</p><p>Gaga’s potential leaves the possibility open that director Todd Phillips could reinvent Harley’s character, as opposed to sticking to the source material from the DC comic books or following version of the role played by Margot Robbie in the Suicide Squad movies and Birds of Prey.</p><p>Entertainer Zazie Beetz might get back in the film as Sophie Dumond as she didn’t die in the first film. It is exceptionally impossible Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy will return as Murray and Penny as they were killed by Arthur in the original film.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Credit: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP/REX</figure><h3><strong>Plot</strong></h3><p>At the end of the first film, Joker left things on something of a cliffhanger. A detained Fleck was secured in Arkham State Hospital at some obscure point after he impelled riots across Gotham City. Fleck broke free after potentially killing his therapist, so Folie à Deux will probably follow him on the run as he proceeds with his descent into becoming Joker.</p><p>The idea of a musical is another fascinating one, recommending that Joker 2 could continue in the strides of everything from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to The Boys having musical episodes. It likewise inclines further into the thought we’ll plunge further into Fleck’s mind this time around.</p><p>Strangely, the title of Folie à Deux could indicate where things are going. The title deciphers as a “delusion or mental illness shared by two individuals in close association” so it seems as though Fleck will be offering the screen to another person. Whether it’s the double character of Fleck and Joker or an immediate reference to Batman/Bruce Wayne having a greater part to play in Arthur’s development, there’s another famous thought.</p><p>There’s another person other than Batman that imparts their life to the Joker, and Folie à Deux is the ideal chance to introduce Harley Quinn to this dark and agonizing world. Very much like Dr Harleen Quinzel worked at Arkham Asylum, Joker’s ending wonderful sets her up.</p><h3><strong>Is Laga Gaga Playing The Role of</strong><strong>Harley Quinn?</strong></h3><p>It is reported that Lady Gaga is at present in early discussions to play the part of Harley Quinn. The A Star is Born entertainer and multi-award-winning singer is set to star opposite Phoenix. Insights regarding Gaga’s role are being “kept under wraps”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/therecenttimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/joker1.jpg><p>In the DC Comics, Quinn is the Joker’s psychiatrist while he is held at the Arkham Asylum mental institution. The pair experience passionate feelings for each other and enter into an abusive on-off relationship.</p><p>When the director teased about the script of Joker: Folie a Deux”, written by him and Scott Silver, speculation began doing the rounds that Harley Quinn would be a part of the sequel.</p><p>It is likewise muddled whether Gaga would likewise contribute any music to the project. The pop star worked with Phillips, who filled in as a producer on her 2018 film “A Star Is Born”, which procured Gaga an Oscar nomination for best actress and win for an original song.</p><h3><strong>Is The Sequel Of The Film Joker: A Musical</strong></h3><p>As per The Hollywood Reporter, a source revealed that the sequel would be musical. There was no extra info on what that would involve, yet fans are as of now left faltering.</p><p>Phillip’s first Joker film was a dark thriller, with gritty energy that left the critics frequently contrasting it with Taxi Driver.
