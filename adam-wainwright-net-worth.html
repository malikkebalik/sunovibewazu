The Atlanta Braves selected him at 29th overall in the first round of the 2000 amateur draft from Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Georgia. His performance in the minor leagues made him regarded as one of the Braves' top pitching prospects. The Braves traded him to the Cardinals after the 2003 season, receiving outfielder J. D. Drew in a deal which has since been considered lopsided in favor of the Cardinals. Wainwright made his MLB debut on September 11, 2005, against the New York Mets.Starting his MLB career as a relief pitcher, Wainwright became a closer late in his rookie season of 2006, saving the series-clinching game of both the National League Championship Series and World Series. The next season, he returned to starting pitching, a role in which he has since remained, except for 2011, which he missed due to Tommy John surgery. He emerged as an ace as he led the National League multiple times in wins, innings pitched, and games started. He also has multiple top-ten finishes in earned run average, strikeouts, walks plus hits per inning pitched, and complete games. In 2014, he became the first pitcher in Major League history to post nine of his first 18 starts with seven innings pitched and no runs allowed. In his career, Wainwright has won more than 100 games, three All-Star selections, two Rawlings Gold Glove Awards and finished in the top three in the Cy Young Award balloting three times.With 1,306 strikeouts in his career to date, Wainwright is second to Bob Gibson in Cardinals franchise history in strikeouts. He runs a fantasy football league where the registration fees go to charity. He is currently signed through 2018. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4.6643990929705><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Adam Wainwright</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$55 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$19.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1981-08-30</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>2.01&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>104&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Glynn Academy</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jenny Curry</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Macy Wainwright, Morgan Addison Wainwright, Baylie Grace Wainwright</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Bill Wainwright, Nancy Wainwright</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Trey Wainwright</td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/unclecharlie50</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm3470661</a></td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Dream Season Celebrity</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=7.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Recorded the final out in both the 2006 National League Championship Series (against the New York Mets) and the 2006 World Series (against the Detroit Tigers) via the Strikeout.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Underwent Tommy John Surgery on his right elbow in February of 2011.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>Finished Second in the National League Cy Young Award voting and became a 20-game winner for the first time in 2010.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>4</td><td>In 2009, he won the Gold Glove Award at Pitcher and also finished Third in the National League Cy Young Award voting, though he did receive the most First Place votes with 12.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals since 2005.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Proximity</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>Roger Leland</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=7><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>2014 MLB All-Star Game</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - National League Starting Pitcher</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Mike & Mike</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - St. Louis Cardinals Pitcher</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sunday Night Baseball</td><td>2006-2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - St. Louis Cardinals Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>Rome</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Guest</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2013 World Series</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself - St. Louis Cardinals Pitcher</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>60 Minutes Sports</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself - Baseball Player (segment "Fantasy")</td></tr><tr><td>Safe at Home</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Prime 9</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Rome Is Burning</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Kids by the Dozen</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2006 National League Championship Series</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself - St. Louis Cardinals Pitcher</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/salary.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/3470661_Adam-Wainwright/3470661_Rome-2014.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/3470661_Adam-Wainwright/3470661_2014-MLB-AllStar-Game-2014.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpqbmqVdrK6qutaroKCgpGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
