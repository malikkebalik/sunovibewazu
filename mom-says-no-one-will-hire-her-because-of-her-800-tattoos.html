She says her boyfriend gives her the tattoos to save on costs.</p><p>The mother of two <a href=# title="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/mum-800-tattoos-banned-pub-30375534?int_source=nba" class=themeColorForLinks>first began getting tattooed</a> at age 20 and hasn't stopped since.

She wants the Guinness Book of World Records to stop by and check.</p><p>"I probably have the most tattoos in the world, and if not then at the rate I’m going on I probably will have in the end — I keep going over and over them,” she said.<br></p><p>It's not just finding a job that's difficult for Sloan, it's going anywhere in public, she says. She claims she's been banned from her children's school and a local bar — all because of her ink.</p><p>Some tattoo parlors won't even allow her in, citing worries about her having too much ink.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmqJ6Wl7KiwI6mpqZlo5bGtHnNqGSoppVixKq4y2afoqqVYrWmvoybnJyZpaiybrvFZp%2Beql1tfXF505qrraefqHquscuiqqyZXai5sK3NZq6apJWoera3jK6loqyVmXqstc2gm6ilXZ67rHnIp6KenF2prrV505qrrGWSmsC1ecCnm2avn6fAtXnTmqutp5%2Boeq%2BxxJ2jnmWWlrCmedOaq62nn2KvsLDYZpqlnZGjtq%2BzjK2moqSVqcA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
