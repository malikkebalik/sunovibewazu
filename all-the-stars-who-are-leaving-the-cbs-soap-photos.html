Whelp, that’s how disappointed we were when before the first autumn leaf had fallen, he was written into a corner and right back off the show, all that potential still untapped.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8932714617169><h2>Michael Mealor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sean-carrigan-in-matt-damon-film-jp.jpg><p>First, rumors spread that Kyle’s portrayer was leaving. Then, Soap Opera Digest reported that contract negotiations between the actor and the show had stalled.

At least she already had her next project to focus on: She’d landed the lead in an ABC comedy pilot called Prospect, in which she was to play a 19th-century schoolteacher who moves to the frontier, only to discover that her new students aren’t kids, they’re full-grown ranch hands!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.44784172661871><h2>Elizabeth Leiner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/yr-hunter-king-gallery-hw-summer.jpg><p>Tara should have been a supervixen for the ages, an old-school Jill or a spare Phyllis.

He wouldn’t be finished airing as newfound Abbott Theo for a while yet, but he was done taping at the CBS show. “I’ve always been an optimist,” he told bummed fans, encouraging them to see that “today isn’t an end but a new beginning.” (It certainly would’ve been <a href=#>if the network had heeded our advice</a>.)</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Donny Boaz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/yr-tyler-johnson-theo-cbs.jpg><p>In the fall of 2020, the health crisis that’s upended the world rocked that of Chance’s portrayer, forcing him to sit out a few episodes — including, unfortunately, his character’s wedding to Abby.

So we had to make do with a short run by the One Life to Live alum (who’d played Garrett) and content ourselves with the notion that maybe someday he’ll return.

Or at least as “final” as anything ever really is in daytime television, where even death is more of a journey than a destination.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9365671641791><h2>Christel Khalil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tristan-Rogers-Returns-GH-SS1.jpg><p>The Emmy winner’s back in the thick of things on The Young and the Restless now — thank goodness! — but she crushed fans in the fall of 2019 when she revealed that she was dropping to recurring status as Lily, the legacy character she’d first played nearly 20 years earlier. Viewers were so upset, in fact, that she had to clarify to <a href=#>Soap Opera Digest</a> that “no, I was not pushed out.” Rather, the network had made a real effort “to try and get me to sign another contract.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.95194508009153><h2>Gina Tognoni</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/yr-christel-khalil-lily-gallery-unsized-jp.jpg><p>Jaws dropped in the summer of 2019 when it was revealed that Michelle Stafford was leaving her General Hospital role of Nina to reclaim her Young & Restless role of Phyllis from her fellow Emmy winner.

A half a year into her run as Rey’s troublemaking wife Mia, Gonzalez announced that she’d already wrapped up at the show.

And it’s not just fans that are disgruntled. “It’s a mystery to me,” <a href=#>tweeted Eric Braeden (Victor)</a> in August 2020, “why Dougie isn’t far more present on a show he helped create!”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4371921182266><h2>Eileen Davidson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/news/2018/09/Doug-Davidson-out-HW.jpg><p>When Ashley’s portrayer left the role she’d played off and on since 1982, the show decided not to recast (as it had twice before). Instead, it took her up on her offer to come back for short stints —&nbsp;and often, as a matter of fact. Which suits the actress. “It’s always great to see my Young & Restless family,” she told <a href=#>Soap Opera Digest</a> in 2019.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4280575539568><h2>Abhi Sinha</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/yr-eileen-davidson-ashley-hw.jpg><p>Ravi wasn’t so much written off The Young and the Restless as…&nbsp;discarded. “Since the new writer took over, I have not been asked back,” <a href=#>he told his admirers</a> in October 2018. “While I have been fortunate enough to not be killed off…&nbsp;the future is uncertain.” Alas, at this point, it’s probably safe to say that his fate in Genoa City is well and truly sealed.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.375><h2>Melissa Claire Egan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/yr-abhi-sinha-gallery-hw.jpg><p>Announcing her departure from The Young and the Restless after six years in January 2018, Chelsea’s portrayer assured fans that “<a href=#>this isn’t goodbye</a>.
