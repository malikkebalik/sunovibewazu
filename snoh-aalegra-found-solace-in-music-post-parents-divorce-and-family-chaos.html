That falls in line with her Swedish upbringing, but that is not where her roots were.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Aalegra&nbsp;was born&nbsp;in Sweden to Iranian immigrants of Persian descent. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the 40,000-person town of&nbsp;Enköping, where she moved to with her mother after her parents' divorce at age two,&nbsp;her ethnicity meant that she stood out with her&nbsp;lean frame, artistic inclinations, and dark features, obviously different from her lighter-skinned peers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Snoh Aalegra Was Called Out for Her Ethnicity</h2><p>Unfortunately, kids aren't always kind to minorities. Aalegra being the only&nbsp;non-ethnically Swedish person in her class, was often made fun of and mocked.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confessed to Playboy</a>, she was called&nbsp;“blatte,” the Swedish equivalent of the n-word, and also “svartskalle”—“black head”—a racist pejorative for a dark-haired or non-European person. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They would be like, ‘You [explitive] svartskalle, go back to where you belong.’ But it was confusing because I’m like, I’m from here. This is my home. So what are you saying?</p><p>As if her social life wasn't suffering enough, she had to deal with the aftermath of her parents' divorce when at home. She had left her extended family back in Uppsala when her mother moved in with her new stepfather.&nbsp;</p><h2>Discovering Her Love of Music</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>While all this was unfolding around her, the 'I Want You Around' songstress' only solace, only confidant was music.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Aalegra couldn't perfectly recall when exactly she fell in love with the art form, but as she told Playboy, she remembered that moment quite vividly.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She was away from the taunts that her peers threw her way for her ethnicity and her parents' home in&nbsp;Enköping. She was with her cousins in Uppsala when the magical moment unfolded.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Aalegra and her cousins had all huddled together in the living room to hear the angelic voice of&nbsp;Whitney Houston on the quivering acapella introduction to 'I Will Always Love You.'&nbsp;</p><p>Aalegra confessed that Houston's voice gave her chills, before adding,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I got goosebumps. I was like, ‘Wow, I want this feeling all the time. I want to be able to do this.’ I wanted to make other people feel it. It was such a grand feeling that I can’t let go of, ever.</p><h2>Music Was Snoh Aalegra's Escape</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After that,&nbsp;Shirley Bassey and Whitney Houston were regulars on her mother’s stereo, alongside Iranian pop greats like Googoosh.</p><p>When she visited her cousins, she would be glued to the TV with her cousins as they watched&nbsp;VHS tapes of 'The Making of Thriller'&nbsp;and Prince and Aerosmith videos that her uncle diligently recorded from MTV.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Looking back, Aalegra's only escape from her parents' divorce and everything else happening at home or in school was music.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She admitted to the outlet that she felt broken as a kid. She claimed that she was still broken.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, she also shared that she had been healing thanks to music, and she is plenty good at making her own.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She signed an artist development deal with Sony Music Sweden when she was just 13 years of age.&nbsp;</p><p>Her portfolio boasts massive album success stories as well as collaborations with the likes of&nbsp;the RZA, Vince Staples, Common, <a href=# rel=follow>John Mayer</a>, and Vic Mensa.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She’s also been sampled by <a href=# rel=follow>Drake</a>&nbsp;and championed by Prince, who took her under his wing until his&nbsp;death in 2016.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuepLVurcClnKCqkWK9or7Ep6usZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmaYqbqt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
