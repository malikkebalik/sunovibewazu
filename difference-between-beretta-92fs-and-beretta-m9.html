They are both reliable, accurate and dependable firearms, but they do have some differences that should be considered before purchasing one. In this article, weâ€™ll look at the key differences between the Beretta 92F and Beretta M9, so you can make an informed decision when buying a Beretta handgun.</p><h2><span id=Design>Design</span></h2><p>The Beretta 92F was the original model in this line of pistols, and it was designed by Carlo Beretta in the early 1970s. The Beretta 92F is a single-action, semi-automatic pistol with an open-top slide and a double-action trigger. The Beretta M9, on the other hand, is a double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a closed-top slide and a single-action trigger. The M9 was designed as an upgraded version of the 92F and was adopted by the U.S. military in 1985.</p><h2><span id=Caliber>Caliber</span></h2><p>The Beretta 92F is available in 9mm Luger, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. The Beretta M9 is only available in the 9mm Luger caliber. However, the M9 can be converted to fire the .40 S&W and .45 ACP calibers with the use of an aftermarket conversion kit.</p><h2><span id=Action>Action</span></h2><p>The Beretta 92F is a single-action pistol, which means that it must be manually cocked before each shot is fired. The Beretta M9 is a double-action pistol, which means that it can be fired without the need for manual cocking. The M9 also has a decocker lever, which allows the user to safely lower the hammer without the need for manual cocking.</p><h2><span id=Sights>Sights</span></h2><p>The Beretta 92F and Beretta M9 both feature three-dot sights for easy target acquisition.

The 92F is slightly more compatible with aftermarket accessories due to its all-steel construction, while the M9 is slightly less compatible due to its aluminum alloy frame.</p><h2><span id=Durability>Durability</span></h2><p>The Beretta 92F is more durable than the Beretta M9, due to its all-steel construction. The M9 is still a durable handgun, but it is slightly less durable than the 92F.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>The Beretta 92F and Beretta M9 are both reliable and accurate handguns, but they do have some key differences.
