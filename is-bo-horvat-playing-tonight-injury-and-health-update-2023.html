However, that was not what emerged out of Horvat’s foot.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Horvat did make a comeback in just five minutes, contributing to three more games throughout regulation and one during OT.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bo Horvat Health Update 2023</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With Horvat’s injury, a list confined to the blue line gains a notable forward.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After being shaken up on Saturday, Scott Mayfield, who missed seven games due to a foot ailment, did not skate on Monday either.
