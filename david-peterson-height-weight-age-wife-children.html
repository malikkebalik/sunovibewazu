He then spent much of his childhood in stables – with his father, an accomplished horse trainer. When David was about 9 years old, his father died of an accidental drug overdose.</li><li>In 2013, he competed in The Under Armour High School All-America Baseball Game, an annual all-star game held to showcase the top high school players (juniors and seniors) in the United States.</li><li>He also used to play basketball during his high school days and had broken his fibula (calf bone) – before his senior year, during one such game. David had to undergo surgery due to which he missed his entire high school senior baseball season.</li><li>Consequently, he fell to the 28th round of the 2014 edition of the MLB (Major League Baseball) Draft (the primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and clubs to MLB’s teams). He then chose not to sign a contract with the&nbsp;MLB’s Boston Red Sox and instead enrolled at the University of Oregon.</li><li>He became the Oregon Ducks‘ number-one starting pitcher in 2017. On March 3, 2017, he set a university record with 17 strikeouts, breaking the previous mark of 14. On April 29, 2017, he extended that record to 20.</li><li>After being selected by the New York Mets in the 2017 MLB Draft, David was assigned to the Brooklyn Cyclones, a MiLB (Minor League Baseball, a league that operates at a rung below Major League Baseball) team and the ‘High-A’ (the 3rd-highest level of play in MiLB) affiliate of the New York Mets.</li><li>He began the 2018 season with the Columbia Fireflies (the ‘Single-A’ (the 4th-highest level of play in MiLB) affiliate of the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball). He was promoted to the St. Lucie Mets (the ‘Single-A’ affiliate of the New York Mets) in June of that year. David then spent the 2019 season with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies (the ‘Double-A’ (the 2nd-highest level of play in MiLB) affiliate of the New York Mets).</li><li>He eventually made his Major League Baseball debut for the New York Mets on July 28, 2020, against the Boston Red Sox – getting the win after pitching 5+2⁄3 innings, giving up 2 runs on 7 hits and an error with 2 walks and three strikeouts in 78 pitches.</li><p>Featured Image by David Peterson / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jp2Yr6GUYr2mwMSrqqimXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
