The Oscar nominee rocked nail polish that matched the color of her dress. She also wore a pair of clear high heels that went along with the Barbie theme of the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/margot-robbie-in-glittery-pink-dress-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Margot took a picture with her co-stars <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>America Ferrera</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Issa Rae</strong></a> and their director <strong>Greta Gerwig </strong>at the premiere. America wore a black blazer dress, Issa wore a pink maxi dress, and Greta wore a gold maxi dress.

Margot has become a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>real-life Barbie</a> on the press tour and her looks have become the talk of the town. When she was in Sydney, the Babylon&nbsp;actress wore a tight strapless <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>black and white striped mini dress</a> that looked just like the swimsuit worn by the original Barbie doll from the 1950s. That same day, she wore a a halter-neck <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Moschino Strawberry Print Cotton-Blend minidress</a>. Margot channeled Barbie, again, when she graced the cover of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue’s</a> summer 2023 issue in a tight pink satin Versace dress. She wore even more <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stunning outfits</a> for the entire cover shoot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the Vogue&nbsp;story, Margot admitted that she never imagined herself playing Barbie until she was deep into the development of the project. She also shared that she didn’t think <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the movie</a> would end up happening. “I was very scared it was going to be a no,” Margot said. “At the time this was such a terrifying thing to take on. People were like, ‘You’re going to do what?’ “ Barbie, which also stars <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong>, <strong>Simu Liu</strong>, <strong>Will Ferrell</strong>, and <strong>Dua Lipa</strong>, is in theaters July 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5JpZqaZopy8tXnRqJmboZVivaq6ymakoqaZYrGzsdKsZJuZope2pnnPq5ymoZWnsm68x6irqKtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
