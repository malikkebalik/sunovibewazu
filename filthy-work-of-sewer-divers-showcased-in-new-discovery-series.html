I’ve been buried digging a hole for an underwater cable. The hole collapsed on top of me, so every time you took a breath, the mud constricts you more. You have to control your breathing, remain calm, and have faith in the guys you have [above the manhole].</p><p>“No matter how scary the job is, the guy next to you has to be as good as you.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Don Gann, aka “Dirty Water Don.” <span class=credit>Discovery</span></figure><p>Gann, a father of three, is based in North Arlington, NJ. He’s a commercial diver specializing in welding, timber work and sewer repair. He’s journeyed down into manholes and waded in<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the muck beneath</a> all five boroughs.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of people think we can just swim around like a fish,” he said. “It’s very difficult to move around with the current and you can’t see what you’re doing. You rely on your 10 eyes, which are your fingers. So, basically, all the dirty and disgusting things that people don’t want to touch – we have to touch those things to understand what we’re doing.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the series premiere, Gann wears a $3,000 rubber suit that keeps him safe from toxic chemicals and waste, and a 36-pound helmet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Don Gann getting his diving suit sanitized by his crew. <span class=credit>Discovery</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“Sewer Divers” is a new show on one of the dirtiest jobs of all. <span class=credit>Discovery</span></figure><p>“Once you hook the neck dam — the suit to the helmet — your mobility becomes spare. It’s hard to get it off by yourself,” he said. “A lot of people in this industry won’t last because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re claustrophobic</a>. The [manhole] is small, the ladders are in disrepair or broken down there. There’s usually a current or the area is very slick so you can’t get good footing or move around. You really rely on your guys up top.&nbsp; There’s quite a few dangers. Electrical shock, a slew of dive-related sicknesses. You could lose a limb. You could lose your life.”&nbsp;</p><p>Gann said that he hopes audiences who tune into “Sewer Divers” get a new appreciation for what he and his colleagues do on the job every day.&nbsp;</p><p>“When someone drives by us in the morning rush and we’re creating a delay for traffic patterns, because we’re closing the lanes — and all they see is three guys standing around a hole — we get a lot of bad press,” he said.</p><p>“They’re like ‘Oh, what are these guys doing, just standing around?’ People drive by and yell at us. We’ve had people drive by and throw trash at us. Meanwhile, under the [surface of the road], you have a guy working to make sure you can go home after work, flush your toilet, and you don’t have to ask, ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Where does it go</a>?’ You rely on the fact that you can hit a button and walk away from it.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtma3Bfm7atwMeyZLCnoqB6sLKMrJywnaJisarCxKuqZquYpMSkrdKem2ahnmK7psOMnaCsm5%2BrsrPFjKycq6GVqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
