Woodman</h2><p>Nicholas D. “Nick” Woodman was born on 24 June 1975, in Woodside, California USA. His parents are Concepcion, of Hispanic descent, and Dean Woodman, a well-known Quaker investment banker. He is a businessman and philanthropist, recognized as the founder and CEO of GoPro, a technology company.</p><p>Reports indicate that Woodman’s net worth is close to $1 billion, as of early 2017, mainly accumulated through his involvement in GoPro.</p><h3>Nicholas Woodman’s Net Worth $1 Billion</h3><p>Woodman spent his formative years in Menlo Park and Atherton, California. There, he became an avid surfer and initiated a surfing club at the Menlo School, funding it by selling t-shirts. He then pursued his higher education at the University of California, San Diego, graduating with a BA in visual arts and a minor in creative writing. Woodman ventured into the business world after completing his studies, founding EmpowerAll.com, an electronic goods website, and Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform. However, both ventures proved to be unsuccessful.</p><p>During a surfing trip in Australia and Indonesia, he conceived the idea of a body-mounted camera to capture action photos and videos. This marked the beginning of his vision for his own camera company. To kickstart this venture, he sold shell necklaces from his van and his mother loaned him money, lending him her sewing machine to make and sell camera straps. With a $235,000 investment and a $200,000 loan from his father, Woodman established GoPro in 2002. The company’s name was inspired by his vision to create a camera system for close-up footage. While the initial models were wearable 35mm film cameras, the company has since evolved its products to advanced compact designs with wifi and waterproof housing, remote control capabilities, micro SD card slots, and affordability for the average action sports enthusiasts, solidifying his net worth.</p><p>GoPro achieved its first major sale at a sports show in 2004, with revenues reaching approximately $150,000 that year, doubling to over $350,000 in 2005. Over time, the company’s sales continued to increase, leading to Woodman’s substantial wealth.</p><p>In 2012, GoPro’s sales of over 2.3 million cameras significantly contributed to Woodman’s success. The company’s market value received a boost in the same year when Foxconn acquired 8.88% of the company for $200 million, elevating its worth to $2.25 billion, thereby establishing Woodman as a billionaire. Following the company’s public listing in 2014, Woodman became the highest paid CEO in the country, granting himself a salary of $235 million.</p><p>By 2015, GoPro had expanded to over 500 employees. However, the subsequent year brought challenges as weak sales necessitated job cuts, initially laying off about 7% of its workforce, and later an additional 15%. Aside from workforce reductions and declining stock prices, Woodman and his business faced other issues in 2016. Allegations emerged that GoPro had misled investors and overstated customer demand, particularly concerning the Karma drone model, leading to a class action lawsuit. In addition, Woodman was later branded as one of the year’s worst CEOs, but the legal case continues.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Woodman married his long-time girlfriend, Jill R. Scully, in 2012, and they have three children together. He actively participates in philanthropy, exemplified when he and his wife donated GoPro shares worth $500 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014, resulting in the establishment of the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation. This act positioned Woodman as one of the most significant donors in the tech industry for that year.</p><p><br>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Nick Woodman</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 24, 1975</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Woodside, California USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Businessman, philanthropist, Founder and CEO, GoPro</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Menlo School, University of California, San Diego</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jill R.
