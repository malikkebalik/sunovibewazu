Larson was been active as a cartoonist from 1976 to 1995.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Gary Larson? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $50 million, as of the data given in the late 2016. Cartooning is the main source of Larson net worth.</p><h3>Gary Larson Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Gary Larson was raised in Tacoma; his parents worked as a car salesman and secretary. Gary was educated at Curtis Senior High School, then attended Washington State University and graduated with a degree in Communications in 1972.</p><p>He began working in a record shop, but realized that he hated his job and decided to take two days off to consider his career. During those days he drew six cartoons and sent them to the Pacific Search, a newspaper in Seattle. Afterwards, he sent some papers to The Seattle Times, and they were published under the title of “Nature’s Way”. In an effort to increase his income, he began working for an association, Humane Society. Later, he sent some works to the newspaper San Francisco Chronicle, which agreed to cooperate and named the strip “The Far Side”. His success was growingfrom then on, making “The Far Side” one of the most famous of comics. One of his most famous jokes presents a couple of chimpanzees – the female finds a blonde hair on the shoulder of the male and asks “Need more research with that slut Jane Goodall?” The Jane Goodall Institute complained about what they considered a sign of bad taste and sent a letter to its distributor. Larson, apologized to Goodall personally, and all the income received featuring the above mentioned institute is given to it. However, his net worth rose considerably.</p><p>Experts praised the creativity of Larson when comparing the behaviour of humans and animals. His single panel comic was featured by Chronicle Features (1980–1985), and then by Universal Press Syndicate (1985–1995). Larson received the award for best periodic publication by the National Cartoonist Society in the years 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995, and it should be said that his comics were published extensively all over the world – “The Far Side” was printed by more than 1,900 newspapers, and collated into a number of books as well as on to calendars, adding to his net worth.</p><p>In 1995, Larson announced his retirement. In 1998, he published a children’s book “There’s a Hair in My Scab!”. In 2007, he released a calendar whose benefits were donated to Conservation International.</p><p>In March 1989, a kind of new insect identified was named in his honour, the Strigiphilus garylarsonis. Since then, a butterfly has been named Ecuador larsoni.<br>Finally, in the personal life of the cartoonist, he married the archaeologist Toni Carmichael in 1987.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.329875518672><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gary Larson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 14, 1950</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tacoma, Washington, United States</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Cartoonist, artist, author, "The Far Side" creator</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>Curtis Senior High School in University Place, Washington, Tacoma; Washington State University, Pullman</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Toni Carmichael</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Doris Larson, Verner Larson</td></tr><tr readability=0.31372549019608><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/TheFarSideGallery/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0488989</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award by the National Cartoonists Society (1985, 1988), Reuben Award (1990, 1994)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Albums</td><td>Doggin' Around (Concord, 1988, cover illustration), "The Complete Far Side", "Prehistory of the Far Side"</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>"New York Times Best Seller" (1998); Serratoterga larsoni, The Garylarsonus (Ecuadorian rainforest butterflies carries his name)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>Simpsons:"Once Upon a Time in Springfield", Tales from the Far Side (1994), Tales from the Far Side II (1997)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Gary Larson's Tales from the Far Side</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=5.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>Creator of "The Far Side" which debuted in the San Francisco Chronicle on 1 January 1980.
