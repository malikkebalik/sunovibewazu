The city lies around 800 miles east of Moscow.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She is the eldest daughter of Leysan Zagitova (Mother) and Ilnaz Zagitova (Father). Zagitova is five years older than her younger sister Sabina Zagitova.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina’s father, Ilnaz, is a former ice hockey coach from Tatarstan. Both of her parents are Volga Tatars. Tatars are an ethnic Muslim minority in Russia to those who don’t know.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, her mother decided that she should move to the capital to find better opportunities in her life. So, Zagitova moved to Moscow to live with her grandmother when she was 13.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina was named after the famous Russian rhythmic gymnast&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina Kabaeva</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. The performance of Kabaeva moved her parents and thus, thought to name Alina after her.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova regards Alina Kabaeva as her role model and says she was impressed with her performance and looks up to her.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Alina-Zagitova-childhood-photo.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Apart from this, Alina loved drawing when she was a child. Also, she is a huge animal lover and has raised chinchillas as a pet.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She also owns an Akita Inu dog given to her by a Japanese as a gift after the Pyeonchang Olympics. She has named her Masaru.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In June 2020, Zagitova passed her Unified State Examinations (USE) and enrolled in the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) to pursue a journalism degree.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina Zagitova | Career as Figure Skater</span></h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How did Alina Zagitova start Figure Skating?</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina’s father was an ice hockey coach for the Neftyanik team. So, Alina was familiar with winter sports, and through his connections, she began official skating lessons when she was four years old.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, she then traveled to Moscow on her own to get professional coaching lessons. Initially, the coaches thought Alina was too fat and not so pretty to make it to the sports. But, she proved them wrong.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova managed to finish 9th at the 2016 Russian Junior Championships with her perseverance. In addition, she placed 12th in the short program and 8th in the free skate.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nevertheless, this was the stepping stone to Zagitova’s professional career.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Becoming World Junior Champion</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova made her international debut in a 2016–17 ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) competition in Saint-Gervais-Les-Bains, France.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She won the gold medal with an overall score of 194.37 points. It was the second-highest score by a single female skater at the junior level.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova took first place in both parts of France, setting new junior females’ records in all categories. With 207.43 points, she won gold, 13 points ahead of her rival and silver medalist </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Anastasiia Gubanova</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thus, she became the first female junior skater in history to achieve more than 200 points.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova competed at the senior level at the 2017 Russian Championships in late December. She </span>placed third in the short and second in the free and thus, won the second position overall.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Russian figure skater won the short program with 70.58 points at Taipei’s 2017 World Junior Championships. She also took the first position and won a gold medal in the free program.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She recorded two new world records in junior ladies’ free skating (138.02 points) and a combined total (208.60 points).</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Becoming the World Champion.</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova debuted her first Grand Prix event of the season in 2018. She was ranked first in both the short program and the free skate.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova also won the short program at the 2019 Russian Championships. However, she struggled and fell twice, resulting in a poor free skate.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite finishing fifth in the free skate and 12th overall, Zagitova was given an automatic spot on the Russian team for the European Championships.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This was because the top three skaters were junior competitors and thus were ineligible.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alina-zagitova-figure-skating.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thus, Zagitova represented Russia in the 2019 European championship and won the short program.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, she struggled in the free skate and even fell once. This had a major impact on her overall score, and she ended up ranking fourth in the free skate.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, her victory in the short program covered her free skate score, and she ended up in second place overall.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitove then represented Russia at the 2019 World Championships held in Saitama, Japan. Again, she gave her best performance, thus earning the season’s best score of 82.08.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova won the 2018 European Championships in Moscow, defeating Medvedeva, who had been undefeated for more than two years. This gave her an entry ticket to Olympics 2018.</span></p><p><a href=#>You may also like reading about <strong>Figure Skater Aljona Savchenko>></strong></a></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Winning the Olympic Gold</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thanks to Alina Zagitova, Russia brought two Olympic medals for figure skating in the 2018 Olympics. Not only the gold, but Russia also set a new Olympic record in figure skating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova’s win in the women’s free skating at the Olympics team event helped Russia win a silver medal in the competition.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She also earned a new personal best and broke the record for the highest-ever technical score in the ladies’ team figure skating with 158.08.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Alina-Zagitova-olympic-gold.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the ladies’ individual event, Zagitova skated a flawless short program to set a new world record of 82.92. She surpassed Medvedeva’s previous mark of 81.61 sets earlier that evening.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She brought home the most anticipated gold medal. It was a huge achievement for Russia, and even Russian President&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Vladimir Putin&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>left a congratulatory message for her on the official kremlin website.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Zagitova Rule</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina Zagitova won gold at the 2018 Winter Olympics with a technique that shocked everyone.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She backloaded her free skate and timed all of her incredible jumps in the second half so that she could take bonus points.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After this, International Skating Union (ISU) applied the new rule that single skaters could only repeat the same two triple or quadruple jumps in their free skating performances.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They could only do four-revolution jumps once. This new rule was named the Zagitova rule.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Hiatus from Peaking Career</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Following the 2019 Grand Prix Final, Zagitova announced that she would be taking a break in her career. As a result, she withdrew from the 2020 European Championships.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zagitova announced that she lacked the motivation to compete and extended her hiatus to 2021 as she has no intentions of a comeback.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On 14 May 2021, Russia’s national team announced that Zagitova is not included in the 2021-22 season; thus, her participation in the 2022 Beijing Olympics is questionable.</span></p><p><a href=#>You may also like reading about <strong>Nathan Chen Bio: Career, Education, Net Worth & Family >></strong></a></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina Zagitiva | Awards and Achievements</span></h2><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Order of Friendship award by Vladimir Putin for her Olympic win at the 2018 Winter Olympics</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Two-time Silver Doe Prize recipient as one of the best athletes of Russia in 2017 and 2018.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Named as ‘</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Athlete of the Year</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>‘ in 2018</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Listed in Forbes Russia’s </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Top 30 Under 30</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> list</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Listed in Top 40 most successful Russians from the sport</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Awarded ‘</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sportswoman of the Year</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>‘ at the 2019 Glamour Russia Awards</span></li></ul><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina Zagitova | World Records</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alina Zagitova is a four-time world record holder under the +5 / -5 GOE (Grade of Execution) system.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She scored 238.43 (Combined total ) and 158.50 ( Free skate record) in the 2018 Nebelhorn Trophy, the highest scores in the respective category.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Fellow Russian figure skater <strong>Alexandra Trusova</strong> broke the score a year later.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, she still holds the highest score in the Senior ladies short program with 79.93, which no one has beaten yet.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before executing the new grading system, Alina set one senior world record score and five junior world records.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She set a historical record of 89.82 in the 2018 Olympics, which has not been beaten yet.
