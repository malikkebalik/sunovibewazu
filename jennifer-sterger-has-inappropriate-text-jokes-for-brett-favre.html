Phil Bryant.</p><p>An&nbsp;<a href=#>investigative report by Mississippi Today</a>&nbsp;revealed text messages showing that <a href=#>Bryant helped Favre</a> obtain at least $5 million in welfare funds in order to help build a new volleyball center at the University of Southern Mississippi. Favre played football at Southern Miss, and his daughter was a volleyball player there at the time some of the texts were sent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Brett Favre and Jennifer Sterger appearing at separate events. <span class=credit>Getty</span></figure><p>Sterger went off about the news in a series of tweets on Tuesday. The former NFL host accused Favre of sending her inappropriate photos in 2010 when he was the Jets quarterback.</p><p>“If you shared this tweet, I politely request you read the last one I posted. And never call me ‘the Brett Favre Girl’ again,” <a href=#>Sterger wrote in a separate tweet</a>.</p><p>Sterger has since pursued a media career, which includes previous work at Sports Illustrated and ABC. She is also a comedian, an actress and a writer, according to her Twitter bio.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">On-field host Jenn Sterger at the New York Jets Vs New England Patriots game at The Meadowlands (Giants Stadium) on September 14, 2008 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">New York Jets quarterback Brett Favre (4) warms up before the start of a game against the Miami Dolphins at Giants Stadium on Dec. 28, 2008, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. <span class=credit>Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</span></figure><p>In other lengthy tweets, Sterger discussed how the scandal affected her reputation and career journey. She said she was <a href=#>“wrongfully cancelled,”</a> an internet trend she doesn’t believe in.</p><p>“Days like today are always tough,” <a href=#>Sterger tweeted</a>. “I want to act like my life isn’t still drastically impacted by another person’s treatment of me, but that would be a lie. To think my legacy and everything anyone knows of me.. can be summed down to the title of ‘The Brett Favre Girl,’ is not only disgusting. But disheartening</p><p>“And every time sports has a #MeToo moment, I’m always somehow the Go-To expert,” <a href=#>Sterger said</a>. “But what we haven’t addressed is this weird hero culture we have created around pro athletes that somehow grants them immunity to consequences…”</p><p>Sterger went on to share that she has<a href=#> been in therapy for years</a> since the Favre scandal.</p><p>“I believe in redemption when people have: expressed remorse. Have done the work. And have taken that work out into the world to show you they learned something from it. Brett Favre has done none of that,” <a href=#>Sterger tweeted</a>.</p><p>“I’m roadkill in his rear view.. And you all are just now discovering that awful people do awful things when there are no consequences. Welcome to the real world,” <a href=#>Sterger wrote</a> in a separate tweet.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Comedian Jennifer Sterger performs during Laugh Factory Takes Over the Main Stage at 2021 Los Angeles Comic Con at Los Angeles Convention Center on December 03, 2021. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Jmamxfn7KvusifnKtlo6mys7PEq2ShmaNitq%2Btz6mpqKiinq61sYytnLGsXZ%2B8rLHSZp2oql2Xv6bA02admq6imnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
