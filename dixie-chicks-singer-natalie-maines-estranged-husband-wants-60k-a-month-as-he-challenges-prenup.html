The documents argue the divorce has put him in a $200,000 debt and that his annual income as $150,000 is just not enough to support both him and his children anymore. He has also demanded that the singer pay him $350,000 in attorney fees for the ongoing legal battle.</p><p>It pointed out that Maines earns $172,000 a month and over $2 million a year, claiming she has a net worth of $50 million with $2.6 million of those in liquid assets alone and another $4.5 million valued in property she owns. Pasdar's lawyers said she is expected to make millions more this year when she goes on tour for her solo album, 'Mother'.</p><p>While they agreed that Maines paid for everything including mortgage, vacation homes, and bills for the kids, they argued it was Pasdar who sacrificed his professional career to focus on the couple's two sons — 17-year-old Jackson Slade Pasdar and 14-year-old Beckett Finn Pasdar — while she continued to focus on her music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/966f51d2-fe77-43b6-9ef6-f46edc7b6610.jpg><p>It is unclear how the demand will go down because the couple, who met in May 1999 at the wedding of Dixie Chicks' Emily Erwin to Charlie Robison, did sign a prenuptial agreement before their June 2000 wedding at the famous A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas.</p><p>Pasdar's lawyers have revealed they are willing to divide up the former couple's assets consistent to the terms of the prenup but have said the actor not receiving spousal support in "unconscionable" even though he did agree to the deal.</p><p>Maines, on the other hand, has accused Pasdar of trying to drag out the divorce for as long as possible so she spent more time and money on it.</p><p>PEOPLE <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Maines filed for divorce on June 30, 2017, citing "irreconcilable differences", with the official separation date listed as June 9, 2017. Pasdar is said to have rejected a settlement proposal last June, with Maines claiming this was a "transparent attempt to secure an unfair litigation advantage."</p><p>The two have maintained a joint custody agreement since their split despite no formal custody or visitation orders being made, and Pasdar's team believes their situation can be sorted out quickly once the prenup situation is handled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonaOpv6K6xp6bZqClqK%2BiusNmm6KwmZp6pLTInKKsZZ6WwaK4yJ5kppmZo7K0edKenKSrXWt9cXyPZphmpZ%2Bjwal50qmmrquRoXqktMilm2arpaW9sL7T</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
