The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>singer</a>, who was part of the musical trio that also included <strong>Beyonce</strong> and <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong>, appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Terrell Show</a> and admitted the original “plan” was for them to go off and do solo projects, but still come back and continue the group as well. Instead, they ended up musically going their separate ways in 2006.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I didn’t want it to be. I don’t know if we wanted it to be the last album,” she said, when asked how she felt about the last release. “But that’s the way it is. But if it was up to me, we’d still be flip flopping. We’d still be group, solo, group solo.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Michelle-Williams-Destiny-Fulfilled-ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I don’t know [why it was the last album],” she continued. “I promise you I don’t. I promise you I don’t. I’m quite positive that, should we and want to do one, I know the door is open for us to do that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Although Michelle didn’t give specific details about a possible future <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reunion</a>, Beyonce’s dad, <strong>Mathew Knowles</strong>, recently told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a> that a reunion will be based solely on whether or not the three singers would want one. “It’s a decision that the ladies would have to make,”&nbsp;he said. “And I would certainly, certainly support that decision as I still manage Destiny’s Child. I would love to see that as well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Michelle-Williams-Destiny-Fulfilled-ev-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>He also said he understands <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that a reunion</a> would bring a lot of joy to Destiny’s Child fans. “I think the fans will be just overjoyed, overwhelmed,” he explained. “And hopefully they do one last time in their career. Hopefully they give us one last album. Who knows? You never know. You never say it can’t happen. Because this is entertainment. A lot of things can happen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49qZqahk52yrbjEZq6ipJyerq6%2FjKWYrKxdmbK0wMinsKxlk522rbCMmqObrZ1isLC5zJ6lratdnru1sdGvoJ6vXau2pbHOaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
