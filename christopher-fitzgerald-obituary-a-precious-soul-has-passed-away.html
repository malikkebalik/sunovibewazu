Fitzy was more than a racer; he was a friend, a source of laughter, and a vibrant presence in the racing community. Known for his quick wit and infectious sense of humor, Fitzy was one of the nicest and funniest blokes around the racing circuit.</p><p>His passion for motorcycle racing was only matched by his ability to bring joy and laughter to those around him. Fitzy’s presence at road race meetings added a special energy, and his absence will undoubtedly be deeply felt by all who had the pleasure of knowing him. Fitzy’s love for racing wasn’t just about the thrill of the track; it was about the camaraderie, the shared moments, and the friendships forged in the fast-paced world of road racing.</p><p>His trademark “Pink Skins” under his leathers became legendary, a quirky and memorable part of his racing persona that endeared him to fellow racers and fans alike. The news of Fitzy’s passing has sent shockwaves through the racing community, and the road race meetings will never quite be the same without his infectious laughter and zest for life. As we mourn the loss of a true racing enthusiast, we celebrate the memories of a friend who lived life in the fast lane, leaving an indelible mark on all who crossed his path.</p><p>Fitzy’s racing number, #29, will forever be etched in the memories of those who shared the track with him. As we say farewell to our friend, we remember him not just as a racer but as a cherished member of our racing family. To Fitzy, may you rest in peace, forever riding in the open roads of our memories.
