He is best known as the first ‘manufactured’ teen idol, and for appearing in popular beach party comedy films during the 1960s as a popular musician and singer.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Frankie Avalon is? According to sources, it has been estimated that Frankie Avalon’s overall net worth is $30 million as of mid-2016, accumulated thanks to the enormous popularity he achieved by the release of his first singles in the late ‘50s, making him one of the most beloved teen idols of the time. His later equally lucrative film career significantly increased his net worth.</p><h3>Frankie Avalon Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>Avalon entered show business as a child prodigy trumpet player, earning an appearance on “The Jackie Gleason Show”. During his teenage years, he played backup trumpet in a local band, where he was discovered by manager Bob Marcucci who launched the future teen star’s career. Frankie’s first single, “Cupid”, came out eight months later in 1957, and his third release “Dede Dinah” reached the Top 10. It was in 1959 that Avalon released his first No.1 single, “Venus” and released another six Top 40 records that same year, a solid start to isnet worth.</p><p>The following year, Avalon got his first movie role, starring in “Guns of the Timberland” which was directed by and starred <a href=#>John Wayne</a>. Even though his music chart domination was coming to an end by 1962, Avalon preserved his successful career by teaming up with <a href=#>Annette Funicello</a> and starring in a series of “Beach Party” surfer films such as “Beach Party”(2013), “Muscle Beach Party”(1964), “Bikini Beach”(1964),”Pajama Party”(1964),”Beach Blanket Bingo”(1965),”I’ll Take Sweden”(1965), “Ski Party”(1965), “How to Stuff a Wild Bikini”(1965) etc. These films were a combination of surfing, comedy, and dancing in bikinis, and achieved great popularity among teenage audiences and made a fortune at the box office. Although he was still recording songs, Frankie was now better known among younger audience for his movies.</p><p>As a sumbol of his era, he went on to appear in the 1950s themed musical “Grease”(1978) in which he sang the “Beauty School Drop-out” song. Four years later, Frankie starred in a film of a completely different genre, the horror thriller “Blood Song”(1982). In 1987 he reunited with Funicello to film a cheerful movie throwback – “Back to the Beach” – and continued to put on nostalgic shows around the country during the late eighties and early nineties by performing the Beach Party hit singles that made them famous. His net worth was maintained.</p><p>When it comes to his more recent activity, Avalon created a line of health and beauty care called Frankie Avalon Products. He also published the “Frankie Avalon’s Italian Family Cookbook: From Mom’s Kitchen to Mine and Yours” in October 2015.</p><p>In his personal life, Avalon has been married to Kathryn “Kay” Diebel since January 1963 and the couple have eight children and ten grandchildren. Two of his sons, Frankie Avalon Jr. a former actor, and Tony, a guitar player, both play on tours with their father.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.47007616975><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Frankie Avalon</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 18, 1940</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.73 m</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Entrepreneur, Playwright, Singer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>South Philadelphia High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Kathryn Diebel</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Children</td><td>Tony Avalon, Kathryn Avalon, Frankie Avalon Jr., Carla Avalon, Joseph Avalon, Laura Avalon, Dina Avalon, Nicolas Avalon</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Nicholas Avallone, Mary Avallone</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Theresa Avallone</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000811/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24242424242424><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/frankie-avalon-mn0000165855</a></td></tr><tr readability=20><td>Movies</td><td>Beach Party, Beach Blanket Bingo, Muscle Beach Party, Grease, Back to the Beach, Bikini Beach, Ski Party, Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, Pajama Party, Fireball 500, The Alamo, Panic in Year Zero!, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, I'll Take Sweden, Sergeant Deadhead, The Haunted House of Horror...</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Easy Does It...
