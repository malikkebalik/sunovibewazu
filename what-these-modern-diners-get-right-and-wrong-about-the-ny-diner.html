But what&nbsp;is a New York diner, exactly?</p><p>New iterations of the breed keep popping up: There’s Carnegie Diner & Cafe, open from 6 a.m. to midnight, at Seventh Avenue and West 57th Street, and the new Soho Diner, chef Ken Addington’s 24-hour spot at the Soho Grand Hotel.</p><p>But these latest “diner” simulations are not the greasy spoons we once knew and loved.</p><p>It used to be that diners, the ultimate all-American eateries, were defined by their structure. Traditionally, these all-day restaurants were harbored in free-standing replicas of train cars. Some of NYC’s most iconic examples, like <a href=# rel=noopener>the Moondance in Soho</a>, are sadly extinct, while a precious few — such as Square Diner in Tribeca, the Pearl in FiDi and Neptune Diner in Astoria — hang in there.</p><p>But “coffee shops” — diners in all but architecture, occupying storefront spaces inside larger buildings — are still kicking, despite some highly publicized closings. Among my modern-breed Manhattan favorites are New Amity, on the Upper East Side, and Midtown’s the Red Flame and Park Café.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/moondance-diner-nyc.jpeg><p>New York City’s modern diners have some shared traits: They serve breakfast all day, stay open late (ideally, all night) and pour the worst coffee in town. Sugar-bomb cakes and pies hold court in display cases, while patrons slouch in square, laminated booths — the most luxurious restaurant seating in the universe, and a diner’s reason for being. There’s an anything-goes culinary spirit (lasagna and a chocolate ice cream soda? Sure!) and an emphasis on speed: Any diner worth its rice-crusted salt shakers can turn out large platters of London broil as swiftly as they can English muffins.</p><p>New Amity co-owner Mario Stivaros said his cozy eatery with colonnaded booths “feels like home. The waiters know everybody. The people are happy.”</p><p>They shouldn’t be “gussied up,” says diner doyen Richard J.S. Gutman — author of “<a href=# rel=noopener>American Diner: Then and Now”</a> and three other books on the subject — although they increasingly are. Newer diners, he says, “stretch the limits of design features,” leaning hard into the 1920s aesthetic that call back to the eatery’s heyday. But a true diner should still be “pretty plain,” he says.</p><p>So, how do Carnegie and Soho measure up?</p><p>Carnegie, run by Stix chef Stathis Antonakopoulos, isn’t as plain as it could be, with its trendy subway-tiled walls and vivid images of musicians from the concert hall across the street. And Soho is so full of HoJo-like decor — counter seats, chrome, Formica, a jukebox — that my dining companion Stephen Silverman announced, “I feel like I’m in Hollywood Studios at Disney World!” (As the author of “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Amusement Park:</a> 900 Years of Thrills and Spills, and the Dreamers and Schemers Who Built Them,” he would know.)</p><h3>Carnegie Diner & Cafe, 205 W. 57th St.</h3><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>18</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p>And can we really call them diners when the coffee I had at both was actually tolerable?</p><p>Still, Carnegie and Soho are a lot more authentic than other joints that hijacked the diner moniker. The Spanish Diner at Hudson Yards is a sprawling brasserie. The mercifully short-lived Bowery Diner served whelks — whelks! — along with scrambled eggs.</p><p>Soho Diner avoids that particular embarrassment. Still, more standard offerings, like huevos rancheros and kasha knish, share the menu with decidedly un-diner-like vegan matcha milkshakes and glasses of orange wine. French fries, problematically, are labeled “market sides.” A high-proof “orange Julius” has a suspicious air of boozy pretension. But juicy, porterhouse-size ham steak and scrambled eggs made up for the shtick.</p><h3>Soho Diner, 310 West Broadway</h3><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>13</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p>For all its modern touches, Carnegie Diner is more comfortingly old-school. Its menu focuses on the classics — waffles and a (damn good) thin-sliced pastrami sandwich — plus a few eyebrow-raisers — Israeli couscous? — as is wont to be the case on the best diner menus. Don’t expect typical diner speedy service — we waited and waited for our food — but they won us back with their lovable, old-timey spirit.</p><p>Take that questionable couscous. Arriving after a long wait (“They couldn’t find it,” the waiter explained), it resembled the cold quinoa and chickpeas of any salad bar.</p><p>Were they sure this was “Israeli”?</p><p>“I’m not sure what nationality,” the waiter said sheepishly. “I’m Greek.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j2pma3BfrLWiwIytn56rlWK6sLDEq6VmnJmjsrO%2FjKCcrWWinrSpwIyapZ1lp6e8r7OMmpmoraRiwamxjKecsGWppL%2BsecOipZ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
