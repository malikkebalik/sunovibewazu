The French boxer used his head, and the blow wounded Clarke.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After some patchwork, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">joined the second round</a> and successfully landed decent close-range shots. But as the second round came to its end, Clarke got another head clash that left him bleeding from a cut above his eye.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the light of the attack, the game's referee, Andy&nbsp;Mustacchio, stopped the match and penalized Aliev with a disqualification. Then, he announced Clarke as the winner.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The interruption and the disqualification were the last things Aliev expected. He furiously shoved a camera, stomped around the ring, and then spat out his mouth guard, shouting, "everyone knows I won." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In a start turn of event, the French boxer sat alone at the end of the ring for over an hour to protest at his disqualification.&nbsp;</p><p>The member of the French coaching team was unhappy with the decision. He&nbsp;claimed that the management did not want France to win in boxing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Clarke was also not thrilled to be victorious in such a manner, but he stated how it was out of his hands. He shared the referee had decided, and they had to believe in his decision.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After that, the heavyweight <a href=# rel=follow>boxer</a>&nbsp;mentioned the head clashes and recalled how a couple of heads&nbsp;were going in. However, he clarified he didn't take it personally.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Whether it’s intentional or not, I don’t know. An orthodox boxing a southpaw — it often happens.</p><p>And indeed, Clarke was&nbsp;among the many who tried to calm&nbsp;down&nbsp;Aliev. He genuinely didn't want his opponent to damage his reputation or be rude to the officials because of his emotions.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I told him to calm down. I’ve been in those situations myself. Often you’re not thinking with your head, you’re thinking with your heart and your emotions are all over the place.</p><p>After the surprising win, Clarke reserved&nbsp;an Olympic medal, a bronze at the least. He will still face&nbsp;Bakhodir Jalolov of Uzbekistan in the semi-finals for a chance at gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Frazer Clarke Addressed His Victory</h2><p>It is fair to say that Clarke&nbsp;got into the semi-finals via a shortcut. But many people were dissatisfied with his victory, prompting the boxer to address the situation and make things clear once and for all.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As a result, Clarke&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Twitter</a> to confront all the negative comments on July 31, 2021. The athlete stressed that the bout's ending was out of his hands and mentioned&nbsp;how the match was a competitive fight, excelling through the rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Addressing the negative comments, the 29-year-old then stated he would not be called a cheater&nbsp;or anything of that sort. He maintained he was only doing his job.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Friends and&nbsp;followers were quick to shower their support to the&nbsp;Burton upon Trent&nbsp;native. Even British sports columnist Steve Bunce shared his thoughts and praised Clarke for trying to calm his opponent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6ilsemvoyco5qqm5p6rrvUq5idZZGhtqbCjJymp6yipMOmvtKyZJunqJ67qHnOpbCmqJmYwG%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
