Shell was born on March 27, 1978 at Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, VA to her mother Doris Carlien Daniels and her father Arthur “Bobby” Knox Jr. (preceded). Mr. Bobby Knox always called Shell “Poosie Duke.” Our mother called Shell, “Her happy baby.” “As long as Shell had her bottle, she was happy!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Shell was the middle child of 5 and she understood the assignment. From day one she stayed in the middle of the action. If you needed to know where to go and how to get there, where the next party was going down or just needed a home girl to hang out with. We called Shell. She was the middle part of the puzzle and she completed the picture. Shell was quiet and reserved, but could get a party started. There’s no party like a Shell Daniels’ party! She knew everybody and everybody knew her. Shell built a village of love, laughter, and fun. In her 45 years Shell gained a mighty following. Michelle was always surrounded by many who cherished and cared for her.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>A native of Virginia Beach, VA where she received her education. Participating in sports like softball, a member of JROTC as a Flag Barrier and many other school activities receiving proper accolades. As she blossomed, so did her friendships. Friends who bonded a kinship so strong, after a while many just called her “Sis.” As a charming and adventurous young lady of Old Virginia Beach Road. She met her children’s father, Julius Fanning and from that union, they created “The Fanning Five.” A legacy well put together. Michelle traveled through life as a sweet and carefree spirit, who chose her own path to walk; while standing steadfast in her decisions. In between raising her children and dealing with the “what’s happenings,” of life. In 2010 Michelle walked across the stage to receive her General Education Diploma. A momentous and proud step towards bigger and better opportunities.</p><p><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>After moving to Chesapeake, VA in 2016 Michelle started her Taco-Bell career at Parkview, where she was a longtime and faithful manager. Her Parkview family loved her immensely. She didn’t stop there, while maintaining Taco-Bell. Shell was trained as Personal Care Assistant and began working private duty. In 2020 she married Raymond J. Bell, together they explored and traveled creating precious memories.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Shell is by preceded in death by her Father Arthur “Bobby” Knox Jr., Maternal Grandparents David Daniels and Anna F.B.Daniels.
