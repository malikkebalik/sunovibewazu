Darren is known as an actor, a composer/songwriter, and a singer, as well as being a co-owner of StarKid Productions, a musical theatre company founded in 2009 along with Matt Lang, Nick Lang and Brian Holden, who all studied together at the University of Michigan.</p><p>So just how rich is Darren Criss? Sources estimate that Darren has managed to accumulate a net worth of $3.5 million, through his varied activities in the entertainment industry.</p><h3>Darren Criss Net Worth $3.5 Million</h3><p>Darren Criss started building his net worth at the age of 10, when he appeared in the musical “Fanny” produced by the theatre company 42nd Street Moon. Later on, Darren performed in such musicals as “Do I Hear a Waltz?” (1998), “Babes in Arms” (1999), “The Voysey Inheritance”, “A Midsummer Night`s Dream”, and “A Christmas Carol”. When Darren was a student at the University of Michigan, he appeared in such projects as “Pride and Prejudice” and “The Cripple of Inishmaan”. However, Darren Criss did not neglect his education, and in 2009 graduated with a BA in Fine Arts from the University of Michigan, majoring in Theater Performance.</p><p>StarKid Productions started with musical comedies, including, “A Very Potter Musical”, “A Very Potter Senior Year” and “A Very Potter Sequel”, in which Darren Criss took the role of Harry Potter. The year of 2012 was successful for the actor, because Darren Criss’ net worth increased significsntly when he&nbsp; replaced <a href=#>Daniel Radcliffe</a> in “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying”.</p><p>Darren Criss is also a TV star. Many performances on TV series’ and shows have benefited the overall size of Darren Criss’ net worth. His first appearance was in 2009 in “Eastwick”, the television series based on John Updike`s novel “The Witches of Eastwick”. Darren also appeared in “Cold Case”, an American detective series.</p><p>Currently, Darren Criss’ net worth has been increasing as the actor performs in “Glee”, a musical comedy television series aired on Fox from 2009 to the present. Darren stares with such famous people as <a href=#>Dianna Agron</a>, <a href=#>Jacob Artist</a>, <a href=#>Melissa Benoist</a>, and <a href=#>Jane Lynch</a> among others.</p><p>Criss has also entered the film industry – he has appeared in “Girl Most Likely”, an American comedy film of 2012 directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, popular partly because of its cast: <a href=#>Matt Dillon</a>, <a href=#>Natasha Lyonne</a>, and Christopher Fitzgerald.</p><p>Darren Criss has enlarged his net worth with incomes from the music industry, too: he actually learned to play several musical instruments when a child. Since 2005 he has been a solo artist, and his musical repertoire includes Disney classics, Great American Songbook, and some other compositions. Sometimes Darren performs along with Theo Katzman and Charlene Kaye, his friends from the studying times at University of Michigan. Since 2011 Criss has been a partner of Sony Music Entertainment. He has already released one album named “Human” in 2010, and currently the singer is producing another album scheduled for release in the near future.</p><p>For the record, whatever Darren does in his life everything comes to music: even “Glee” is known for many Criss` musical performances.</p><p>In his personal life, Darren remains unmarried, but is currently dating <span id=ext-gen81>Mia Swier, a musician and associate television producer.</span></p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=24.93023255814><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Darren Criss</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 5, 1987</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Francisco, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.73&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>152 lbs</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Singer-songwriter, Composer, Musician, Businessperson</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>University of Michigan, St. Ignatius College Preparatory, Stuart Hall for Boys</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Charles William Criss, Cerina Bru</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Chuck Criss</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Darren Everett Criss , Dcriss , Dare</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/darrencriss</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/darrencriss</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/darrencriss</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm2023050</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Breakout Star</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Music Groups</td><td>StarKid Productions, Glee Cast</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nominations</td><td>Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Male Scene Stealer, People's Choice Award for Favorite On-Screen Chemistry, People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Bromance, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music An...</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>The Tale of Princess Kaguya, Girl Most Likely, Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, The Chicago 8, Kangaroo Court</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>TV Shows</td><td>Hairspray Live!, Glee, Eastwick, American Crime Story, Little White Lie</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=42.397373981286><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=31><td>1</td><td>It's a subject that's very near and dear to my heart, simply because I grew up in such an open community-doing theater in San Francisco. I mean, it doesn't get much, stereotypically, "gayer." I was inadvertently raised in the "gay community." I had straight parents, but I spent massive amounts of time at a very early age with gay, theater-hopeful thirty-somethings. And those were the people I spent time with early on, so my whole perception of "sexuality" just wasn't there. It just...was. It even got to the point where, later in life... I had all the components in place. I was, well, not super effeminate, but I was into girly things-I liked musical theater, all the stereotypical things. I had to come out and say, well, I'm sorry, but I think I'm straight. And people were like, say it ain't so! And I would say, "It's been a secret too long, but I'm actually a straight male." And so for the longest time when people asked me about Blaine, I wanted to say It doesn't matter. And it doesn't. But I don't want to devalue it, because it's a very earnest question, and I can see why people would want to know. And I realized that if I said, It doesn't matter, that immediately means that I'm gay. So I do define myself as a straight male, but it really doesn't come into play with me in this role. As an actor, your objective is always to play the scene. And this case, he happens to be a gay teen.</td></tr><tr readability=15><td>2</td><td>I was fighting a bear in Canada. I was on the verge of death and looked him straight in the eye, and the bear took pity on me before I took my last breath. "Is there anything you want before you die, I'm a bear of honor," he asked. And I said, "I really want to go out for Glee." And he said, "it just so happens I know the casting director, I'll get you over there right now. But I'm going to kill you if you don't get it." So I went into the casting office, and I said, "I really want to do this part, and if I don't get it, the bear's going to kill me." So they gave me this part. And the bear let me live. And now he's a good friend of mine and a big fan of the show.</td></tr><tr readability=2.9160839160839><td>3</td><td>[on his success in <a href=#>Glee</a> (2009)] What's happened to me is not normal.
