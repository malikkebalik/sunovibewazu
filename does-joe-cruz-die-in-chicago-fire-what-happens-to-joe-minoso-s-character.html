Keep reading to find out.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Fire</a>&nbsp;is NBC’s hit procedural that follows the professional and personal lives of the firefighters, rescue personnel, and paramedics at the Chicago Fire Department’s fictional Firehouse 51. Produced by Dick Wolf, the series is the first installment of the One Chicago franchise, which includes the spinoffs&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago P.D.</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Med</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>now-canceled&nbsp;Chicago Justice</a>. It first premiered in 2012 and is currently on its 12th season.</p><p>Joe Minoso has starred as Joe Cruz, a firefighter with Squad 3, since Season 1. He first joined Chicago Fire in a recurring role before he was promoted to a series regular in Season 2. Cruz is one of only five original characters left on the show, along with Christopher Herrmann (David Eigenberg), Randall “Mouch” McHolland (Christian Solte), Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) and Wallace Boden (Eamonn Walker).</p><p>It’s hard to picture Squad 3 without Cruz, but a promo for the 12th episode of Season 12 suggests that the firefighter might not make it out of a call alive this time. Here’s everything we know about Cruz’s fate on the show.</p><h2>Does Joe Cruz die on Chicago Fire?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Joe-Cruz-Chicago-Fire-3.jpg alt="Joe Cruz - Chicago Fire" width=1371 height=800 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Does Joe Cruz die on Chicago Fire? We don’t know for sure, but the veteran firefighter appears to be in grave danger in the upcoming episode “Under Pressure.”</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">the promo</a>, Cruz and the rest of the squad arrive at the scene of a burning building. The clip then cuts to Severide telling Paramedic in Charge Violet Mikami (Hanako Greensmith): “That’s Cruz, he must be out of air.” Cruz is then seen wandering around the building alone, looking lost. “Cruz report!” Severide can be heard yelling into his radio. The promo ends with Cruz coming out of the building and collapsing on the ground, seemingly unconscious, as Violet tends to him.</p><p>On top of his life being at risk, Cruz will also be dealing with some <a href=# rel=noopener>marital qualms with his wife, Chloe</a> (Kristen Gutoskie). The episode’s description reads: “Severide and Violet risk clashing with Paramedic Chief Robinson after Lennox makes a dangerous decision on a call; Capp and Tony attempt to break a world record; Cruz and Chloe’s marriage problems come to a head.”</p><p>It’s unclear what issues the couple are facing, but perhaps seeing her husband in danger will push Chloe to the edge and make her question their union. The pair met during a building fire in the Season 7 crossover episode “Going to War.” They went on to tie the knot in Season 8 and welcome a son, Brian Leon “Otis” Cruz, in Season 10. Also in Season 10, Cruz and Chloe took in an orphan named Javi and eventually adopted him. They faced a hurdle with Javi this season in “The Wrong Guy,” when Javi’s uncle turned up and wanted to get in contact with his nephew. As it turned out, the man was a scam artist who insisted that Cruz give him $50,000 to go away. Luckily, the scammer was arrested, but the ordeal could have caused a strife between Cruz and Chloe.</p><p>So far, there has been no news that Minoso is planning on leaving the show, but Chicago Fire has killed off plenty of characters in the past. Viewers will just have to tune into the penultimate episode to learn if Cruz and his marriage survives.</p><p>Chicago Fire airs on NBC on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><b>For more on Chicago Fire, check out this gallery to see where the <a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Fire alums are now</a>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2V%2BcnyOnKmusl2ZtqZ5wqGgnJmXpHqntdGeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
