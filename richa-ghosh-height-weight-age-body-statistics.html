Just about a year later, she made it to the state’s under-23 team. She was inspired by her father, a cricket umpire, and a former cricketer at the local level.</li><li>In January 2020, aged just 16, she was included in India’s squad for the 2020 edition of the ICC Women’s World T20. In mid-February 2020, just before the start of this tournament, she made her WT20I (and international) debut for India.</li><li>At the 2022 edition of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, she played all 7 of India’s group-stage games but endured a torrid time – scoring less than 100 runs combined despite batting in all of those matches. The tournament was a disaster for the Indian team as well as they could not make it to the semi-final stage, having finished as the runner-up in the previous edition (2017).</li><li>In February 2023, in the auction for the upcoming inaugural edition of the WPL (Women’s Premier League), Richa’s power-hitting skills fetched a handsome amount of INR 1.90 crores as she was picked up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore.</li><li>At the 2023 edition of the ICC Women’s World T20, she was India’s 2nd-highest (and 9th overall) run-getter – 136 runs in 5 innings at a stellar average of 68 runs per inning and an excellent strike rate of 130.76 runs scored per 100 balls faced. Although India reached the semi-final of the tournament (where they lost to eventual champions Australia by just 5 runs), Richa was the only Indian player selected in the ICC‘s ‘Team of the Tournament’.</li><p>Featured Image by Richa Ghosh / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqugnKCRYrSpu9KhZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
