The news of her death brings sorrow to her fans and the entertainment industry as a whole. Parady’s son, Jonathan Peverall, revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that his mother had valiantly battled a brain tumor for an extended period.</p><p>According to reports from USA Today, Parady had also faced the challenge of meningioma, a prevalent type of tumor that originates from the meninges – the protective membranes around the brain and spinal cord, as explained by the Mayo Clinic. This condition can exert pressure on the brain, nerves, and surrounding blood vessels, leading to a range of complications.</p><p>In response to the news of Parady’s passing, social media platforms overflowed with tributes and condolences. The official Facebook page of “Little House on the Prairie,” a show in which Parady portrayed the character Alice Garvey, shared a poignant message:</p><p>“Our hearts go out to her family, friends, and fans during this difficult time. Rest in peace, Hersha Parady. You will be deeply missed”</p><p>Fellow actress Melissa E. Gilbert also paid her respects, posting a photo of Parady on Facebook and reminiscing about their time working together.</p><p>Parady’s health struggles had been widely acknowledged. Her son Jonathan had initiated a GoFundMe campaign in July to gather support for her medical expenses. Meningioma had taken a toll on her memory, strength, and personality, rendering her bedridden and hindering her daily activities.</p><p>Meningioma, known for symptoms like vision changes, headaches, and memory loss, had presented significant challenges for Parady and her family. The decision for surgery was complicated by the lengthy recovery process and the financial strain it would impose on the family.</p><p></p><p>GoFundMe description highlighted:</p><p>“Upon seeing her condition during a recent visit to her home in Van Nuys, we decided to move her from Los Angeles to live with me and my family in Virginia, and while we are working to ensure she gets the medical help she needs, the costs associated with her care are mounting.”</p><p>“We’re looking at surgery to hopefully improve her condition, but the road to recovery is a long one, and the costs go beyond just medical. From moving expenses to in-home nursing care, to medical equipment and more, the financial burden is significant. And with a full time job and three kids, providing her with the level of care she needs is difficult.”</p><p>Jonathan described his mother as an independent woman who had contributed significantly to television since the 1970s. The family’s efforts to provide care for Parady were met with heartfelt support from well-wishers, with donations totaling $20,830 raised so far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/jobsbots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2508230120.jpg><p>Hersha Parady’s television career spanned several decades, making her mark in shows such as “Bearcats!” and “Mannix.” However, it was her portrayal of Alice Garvey in “Little House on the Prairie” that resonated deeply with audiences.
