He encounters a strange woman who makes him nervous but offers him breakfast. She then asks him if he comes from a land down under, a reference to Australia. The singer is then asked if he belongs to a place where women glow and men plunder, followed by a warning to take cover from the thunder. The song then describes the singer's encounter with a man in Brussels, who offers him a Vegemite sandwich and references the flowing beer and men's chunder in the land down under. The song then shifts to the singer lying in Bombay's den with a man trying to tempt him because he comes from the land of plenty. The song ends by repeating the chorus, emphasizing the description of the land down under, where women glow, and men plunder.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Traveling in a fried-out Kombi On a hippie trail, head full of zombie</u><br>I was driving in a beat-up Volkswagen van on a carefree journey, feeling a bit zoned out</p><br><p><u>I met a strange lady, she made me nervous She took me in and gave me breakfast</u><br>I encountered a peculiar woman who made me uneasy, but ultimately took me in and provided me with a meal</p><br><p><u>Do you come from a land down under? Where women glow and men plunder? Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover</u><br>Are you from Australia? It's a wild, vibrant place with unpredictable weather and potential danger. Beware!</p><br><p><u>Buying bread from a man in Brussels He was six-foot-four and full of muscle I said, "Do you speak-a my language?" He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich And he said</u><br>I purchased some bread from a tall, strapping gentleman in Belgium and tried to converse with him in my native tongue. He didn't understand, but kindly offered me a traditional Australian sandwich spread, Vegemite</p><br><p><u>I come from a land down under Where beer does flow and men chunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover, yeah</u><br>I hail from Australia, a place where drinking beer is a pastime and sometimes leads to vomiting. The weather is unpredictable and dangerous. Beware!</p><br><p><u>Lyin' in a den in Bombay With a slack jaw, and not much to say I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me Because I come from the land of plenty?" And he said</u><br>I was lounging in a room in Mumbai, feeling relaxed and content. Upon being offered something, I questioned whether the offer was an attempt at tempting me since I come from a prosperous country</p><br><p><u>Oh, you come from a land down under? (Ooh, yeah, yeah) Where women glow and men plunder? Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover ('cause we are)</u><br>The person I was speaking to recognized that I came from Australia and followed it up with the same warning - it's a dangerous place with unpredictable weather and people who are opportunistic</p><br><p><u>Living in a land down under Where women glow and men plunder (Can't you hear thunder) can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover</u><br>Life in Australia is wild and crazy, with gorgeous women and men who are always on the lookout for opportunities. Thunder rumbles and danger is imminent - take heed and protect yourself</p><br><p><u>Living in a land down under Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? (Ooh yeah) Better run, you better take cover (we are)</u><br>The refrain is repeated, emphasizing the dangerous yet tantalizing nature of life in Australia. Glory abounds, but so does jeopardy - look out and protect yourself</p><br><p><u>Living in a land down under (ooh yeah) Where women glow and men plunder Can't you, can't you hear the thunder? Better run, you better take cover</u><br>The song concludes with a final warning about Australia - it's a seductive and beautiful place, but it's also full of potential danger. Beware and take cover when the thunder rolls</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: Colin James Hay, Ronald Graham Strykert</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIWVo6yiwL6QpqujX4Gur7C%2Bfaawpo%2BKu6Wx0Q%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
