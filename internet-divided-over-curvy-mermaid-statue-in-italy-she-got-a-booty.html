At least not any I know,” Schiavarelli said, according to The Guardian.&nbsp;</p><p>Whoopi Goldberg weighed in during a segment on “The View,” saying “she got a booty” and ridiculing people for making such a big deal about something that is “not real.”</p><p>“I don’t think kids are thinking, ‘Ooh, she’s sexy,’” Goldberg said before the hosts devolved into an argument about how a mermaid can have both a backside and a fishtail.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A new statue of a mermaid in Monopoli, Italy has caused controversy of social media. <span class=credit>The Monopoli Times</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The statue was made at IISS Luigi Russo art high school. <span class=credit>Luigi Rosso Art School</span></figure><p>Another host expressed surprise the controversy had&nbsp;occurred in Italy, which has “so much naked art all over the place.”&nbsp;</p><p>A picture of the statue made a splash on social media, with most users focusing on the fact that the controversy surrounded a fictional creature.&nbsp;</p><p>One social media user, posting a screenshot of The Guardian’s report, said the statue was “a disgrace” because “mermaids famously do not have human butts, the tail goes up to their hips.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The mermaid statue is a tribute to late Italian senator and Nobel laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini. <span class=credit>The Monopoli Times</span></figure><p>Another user mocked the controversy, saying, “Right. Of course!
