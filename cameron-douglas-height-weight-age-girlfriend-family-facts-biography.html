He has gone on to add that it was his family’s love and support during his adverse times that had given him the urge and strength to pull through.</li><li>Cameron has disclosed that the birth of his baby daughter had made him get in touch with a whole new depth of love that he had previously never even realized he had within himself. That had also made him see his parents in a little different light as he could then really relate with them and begin to see some of the things that they were experiencing and so it had also brought about a whole new level of respect for his parents.</li><li>A word he has loved is “fortitude” because of the way it rolls off of the tongue and, more importantly, because of its powerful meaning that has inspired him.</li><li>Cameron has considered a National Geographic coffee table book to be the one book he would love to give as a gift to others, being confident that it will be enjoyed regardless of the receiver’s taste or character.</li><li>He has thoroughly enjoyed reading historical fiction as he has loved history and also realized that if it is done very well, it has the ability to edify the reader without even making them aware of the wonderful fact that they are learning lessons about history itself. Cameron has believed that having a knowledge of history arms one with a more advantageous outlook when looking toward the future.</li><p>Featured Image by Cameron Douglas / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpyYpp2ipLtusM6unqWZo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
