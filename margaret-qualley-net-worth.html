According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Qualley’s net worth is as high as $6 million, an amount earned through her successful career, active since 2011.</p><h3>Margaret Qualley Net Worth $6 Million</h3><p>The younger daughter born to Andie MacDowell and <a href=#>Paul Qualley</a>, she has an older brother, and sister Rainey Qualley, who is an actress and dancer herself. Margaret spent her early years on a ranch in Missoula, Montana, but following the divorce of her parents when Margaret was five years old, she moved between her parents’ houses.</p><p>She then settled in Asheville, North Carolina, where she became interested in dancing, and along her sister made her debut at the Bal des Débutantes in Paris. When she turned 14, Margaret left home and enrolled at the North Carolina School of the Arts to study dance, which earned her an apprenticeship at the American Ballet Theatre, while also studying at New York’s Professional Children’s school. However, after two years, Margaret decided to change her career path and become a model, and then an actress, enrolling at the London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, taking its summer course. She is now a student at the New York University.</p><p>In 2011 Margaret made her debut as a model, appearing in the New York Fashion Week for Alberta Ferretti. Since then, she has modeled for Chanel, Valentino, as well as appearing in <a href=#>Ralph Lauren</a> Fall/Winter print campaign for 2016, being photographed by Steven Meisel, one of the most successful fashion photographers in the industry. After she became known in the modeling world, Qualley featured in several fashion magazines, including Teen Vogue, W, Nylon, and Vanity Fair, among others, which only increased her net worth.</p><p>Following the end of her acting course, Margaret started pursuing acting engagements, and in 2013 made her debut in the film “Palo Alto”, directed by Gia Coppola and starring <a href=#>Emma Roberts</a>, <a href=#>James Franco</a> and Jack Kilmer. The following year, Margaret made her breakthrough when she was chosen for the role of Jill Garvey in the TV fantasy drama series “The Leftovers” (2014-2017), which added a considerable amount to her wealth, while also launching her to stardom. Since then, Margaret has appeared in a number of successful projections, such as the action comedy “The Nice Guys” in 2016, starring <a href=#>Russell Crowe</a>, <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> and Angourice Rice, then in the mystery drama “The Vanishing of Sidney Hall”, while most recently she starred in the adventure crime-drama “Death Note” (2017), next to <a href=#>Nat Wolff</a> and Lakeith Stanfield, further increasing her net worth.</p><p>She is also working on several projects, including the films “Adam” and “Io”, both scheduled for release late in 2018.</p><p>Margaret resides in Los Angeles, California and shares an apartment with her sister, who she describes as her idol.
