The ban was first thought to be a permanent one. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the platform has since restored her account, and the video is still up, though it looks like she regretted her choice to make the post after her ban. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Addison Rae Twerks On TikTok</h2><p>On April 7, 2022, Rae uploaded a slightly provocative video on TikTok, although the provocative part comes on a bit later.</p><p>The video starts with a robotic voiceover that says, "when he says he'll take u to Cabo," as the camera is pointed towards what looks like a swimming pool view at night. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The music</a> that plays in the background is a remix of 'I WANNA RIDE' by Joseline Fernandez.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Then, the camera pans to the left, and there, Rae is seen. She is dressed in a white dress and&nbsp;twerking, facing a few more swimming pools on a sofa, at what looks to be a resort. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><p><strong>Addison Rae got banned on TikTok for posting a twerking video, but the ban was only temporary.</strong> (Photo: Addison Rae/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>As the clip ends, she turns over and jokingly looks at the lens with a big grin. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The caption she put up also suggests that the video is just a fun bit she was doing, presumably getting in on the 'I WANNA RIDE' trend&nbsp;on the platform nowadays.</p><p>"I'm just joking lol haha," she wrote in the caption.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The comment section was, however, filled with people either disagreeing with her or just plain confused. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The first comment read, "in what was is this a joke" as another user wrote, "Posted on the wrong app." This user would be proven right later.</p><p>"This&nbsp;def gonna be down in an hour," a third chimed in with similar sentiment.</p><p>Many others were in agreement that Rae might have been heavily intoxicated when she made the video. "ngl she prolly drunk y'all forget she's 21," another suggested.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Someone else just wrote, "ok what is this addison," looking for some clarification.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Addison Rae Banned on TikTok for Twerking Video</h2><p>On April 12, 2022, Rae took to Twitter to let everyone know of the aftermath of her behind-shaking stunt on TikTok.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"I knew I should've deleted the twerking video," Rae wrote in her tweet, followed by a few crying emojis. She included a screenshot of the notice she got from the platform after getting banned.</p><p>The notice just read the usual â€” it said&nbsp;she had been "permanently banned due to multiple violations of our Community Guidelines." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, a day from her tweet, her TikTok is back and active. The platform has also left the twerking video post untouched.</p><p>This isn't Rae's first scare with getting banned on TikTok. She was <a href=# rel="follow noopener">kicked out</a> of the platform for a short while in October 2021.</p><p>At the time, she "violated the community guidelines" by focusing a post, again, on her behind. Her account was restored soon.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But this latest ban was more concerning as it comes at a time when TikTokers are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">getting banned</a> left, right, and center. Creators with massive followings on the platform, such as <a href=# rel=follow>Bella Poarch</a> and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Charli D'Amelio</a>, have also been temporarily suspended lately.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmUmba0u81mqZqdXam2rMDOpGSbmZ6jsqV6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
