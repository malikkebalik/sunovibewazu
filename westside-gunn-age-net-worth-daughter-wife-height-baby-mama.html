The pair also comprises the rap duo called “Hall N’ Nash.”</p><p>A natural-born leader, Westside – five feet & six inches (165 cm) in height – didn’t begin recording music until Conway got shot in the face.

No doubt, he wouldn’t have trouble landing a girlfriend or a wife, for that matter.</p><p>True to his playboy persona in his musical output, Westside – for the most part – refuses to settle down.</p><p>His reluctance to find something meaningful in relationships is largely due to his fathering duties. Westside has a daughter named Pottie (born 2013), who appeared on the rapper’s song “Amherst Station.”</p><p>In 2019, Westside became a father for the second time. Speaking on the podcast “itsthereal” in fall that year, the “Pete Sake” wordsmith broke the baby news.
