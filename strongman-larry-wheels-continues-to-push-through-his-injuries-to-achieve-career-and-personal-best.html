While the content on his YouTube channel is full of his workout and personal record videos, there is also&nbsp;no shortage of videos of him getting injured.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span>Despite the potential career-ending injuries, Wheels continues to push the boundaries of his physical endeavors to bring his best self out.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Went Through a Major Bicep Injury in 2019</h2><p>Wheels began his competitive career as a powerlifter and subsequently&nbsp;got&nbsp;into bodybuilding, arm wrestling, and strongman competitions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His journey through these events has been well documented on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his YouTube&nbsp;channel</a>.&nbsp;The documented videos- which have earned him more than 1.4 million subscribers- also publicizes his injuries. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> to Generation Iron Fitness & Bodybuilding Network</a> in 2019, the strongman shared he&nbsp;<span>wasn't scared of getting injured inside the gym. He reasoned that he could recover from such injuries through rehab and surgery.</span></p><p>As long as it happens in the gym, I can rehab it. Now, if I get in a car accident, that I am scared of because who knows what could happen in a car accident...it’s not the same as pulling a hamstring when you’re deadlifting or pulling a pec.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Among many injuries, the worst one was when Wheels tore his bicep in 'The World's Strongest Man' competition in 2019. He had attempted to lift one of theatlas stones,</span><span>&nbsp;that weigh between 100 to 160 kg.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>Since his entire career revolves around his body and strength, the injury could&nbsp;have potentially ended his career. Thankfully, he recovered after proper treatments and three months of rest.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He then celebrated his recovery&nbsp;by posting a deadlift video on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>Wheels has been through dozens of other training injuries. He has endured a bruised hand when a back bar ricocheted off the ground and hit him,&nbsp;torn hamstring when he was doing upright rows, a loose body (detached bone or cartilage)&nbsp;on his elbow,&nbsp;and an ankle injury while attempting a 920lbs&nbsp;squat. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Wheels Has Set Multiple&nbsp;World Records</h2><p>Despite the obvious risk and injuries, Wheels continues to push himself for a better personal record. And in some cases, he has even managed to set&nbsp;new world records.</p><p>For instance, he made history by breaking the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">world record</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> for powerlifting</a> at the 2020 Arnold Sports Festival.</p><p>To break the previous record of 2369.9 pounds set by Eric Lilliebridge,&nbsp;the Powerman did an 870 lbs squat, 635 lbs bench, and 855 lbs deadlift. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Triumphantly, he set a new record of 2370 pounds.</p><p>The weightlifter also broke Eddie Hall's&nbsp;(the 2017 World’s Strongest Man) dumbbell press&nbsp;world record. He pressed 242 lbs dumbbells for three reps&nbsp;while Eddie had only done a single rep with the same weight.</p><h2>Making His Return in September 2021</h2><p>On June 25th, Wheels took to&nbsp;Instagram to state that&nbsp;he had moved to New York to train and intended to compete in the powerlifting meet 12 weeks later.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Wheels&nbsp;will be taking part in the&nbsp;Revolution Powerlifting Syndicate's (RPS) 'Long Island Insurrextion' competition.&nbsp;</p><p>The competition is&nbsp;scheduled for September 11th, 2021, and will be hosted &nbsp;in Farmingdale, New York.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>His last&nbsp;competition was&nbsp;the 2020 Arnold Sports Festival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwuMCrqbJlp52yprjSZqCnoqWnxm%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
