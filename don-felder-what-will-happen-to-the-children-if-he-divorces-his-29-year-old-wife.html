He started his first band when he was fifteen. He was afterward asked to add slide guitar to the Eagles’ song “Good Day in Hell,” after which he received an invitation to join the group the next day.</p><p>Don sued his former bandmates Don Henley and Glenn Frey for treating him as a helping hand throughout their journey after being fired from the Eagles in 2001. In his complaint, he made an additional, secret demand. Don Felder will officially be inducted into the Nashville Musician’s Hall of Fame in October 2016. His staggering net worth is currently believed to be $60 million.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also read: Parker Boudreaux, Paul Wight, Britt Baker, Satnam Singh"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1061505,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial","16":9,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":27}{"1":29,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":39}{"1":41,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":52}{"1":54,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/parker-boudreaux/"}{"1":27}{"1":29,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/paul-wight/"}{"1":39}{"1":41,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/britt-baker/"}{"1":52}{"1":54,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/satnam-singh/"}{"1":66}'>Also read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Parker Boudreaux</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Paul Wight</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Britt Baker</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Satnam Singh</a></span></p><h2><span id=Is_Don_Felder_Married_Relationship>Is Don Felder Married?

And as we already stated, when the major catastrophe occurred, everything began to fall apart, and he was forced to divorce Susan. He stated the following in a 2012 interview with “something else!”</p><p>“I went through a separation and divorce with my wife within a year of when I quit the band. Therefore, every image I had adopted and had been wearing for almost 30 years was peeled away. I was no longer in a rock band, with a group of individuals I called my buddies in the Eagles, married, a parent, or a family man. After almost three decades of marriage, the pair split in 2000.</p><p>His youngest daughter Leah Jenner, @Leah Jenner, who is now a musician, actress, writer, composer, and mother, is one of his four children who most closely resembles him. On May 31, 2012, she wed actor and composer Brandon Jenner (@sprandoni), who is also a musician. On July 22, a daughter was born to them; she was given the name Eva James Jenner.</p><p>Her other siblings have not gained notoriety besides Leah.</p><p>There are no reports of Don Felder being involved in an affair or dating a woman at this time.
