But the show has us even more intrigued by the prospect of what comes next.</p><p class=p1>See, sure, it’s sad that Tom’s dead and all. And we want to know whodunit. But we have a feeling that this arc is only a precursor to a larger murder mystery.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>What makes us so sure? Justin returned to the scene just in time to be a suspect. And while we can’t imagine why he’d want Tom pushing up daisies, we can think of a lot of reasons he’d want to make trouble for the Forresters, Spencers and Logans.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/justin-guilty.png alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=p1>As shady as Justin is, we could see him having used his cunning to bug the offices of Forrester Creations, then blackmailing former coconspirator Ridge. If the dressmaker doesn’t pay, and handsomely, Justin will sell Bill his recordings of Hope discussing <a href=# rel=noopener>her attraction to Steffy’s husband</a>, Steffy hitting the roof over the idea of having to work with Brooke, and the <a href=# rel=noopener>real reason “Thope” broke up</a>. Eye on Fashion sales would go through the roof!</p><p class=p1>At the same time, Justin could also be blackmailing his former friend Bill and his new family with what he’s learned about the night Luna accidentally spent with Zende. How much would it be worth to Justin’s ex-bestie to keep his sweetheart and their daughter from being publicly embarrassed? Eye on Fashion wouldn’t run such a story, but TMZ would eat that [bleep] up!</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1338-x-374-The-Bold-and-The-Beautiful.png alt="Text reads, Subscribe to Soaps' Bold and Beautiful Newsletter.

Finally, Justin could extort money from Eric by warning that if he doesn’t hit the jackpot to end all jackpots, he’ll go public with tapes of the Forrester family patriarch discussing his ED, his decision to let Quinn satisfy her carnal desires with Carter and how Donna finally solved his little “downstairs problem.”</p><p class=p1>Basically, every character on the canvas would want to see Justin shut up and put down. It would be a murder mystery on steroids. What do you think? Is Tom’s death just the opening act for an even graver matter? <strong>Speaking of Tom, review <a href=# rel=noopener>the suspects in his murder</a> below.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmraCVYq%2BwuMNmmKecXam1pnnBnpiurJmbwq17zZ6urGdnaIN3hZhooa6rpJ67bq7LmpqkpZGeuW651Kubnqpdosa0wMSrsGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
