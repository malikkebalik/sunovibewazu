Salma looked effortlessly gorgeous in her chic outfit, and her girls were wearing outfits that were to die for as well! Salma’s husband <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>François-Henri Pinault</strong></a>, 60, is the founder of Kering, which owns Gucci, so it wasn’t surprising at all that Salma, Valentina, and Mathilde were there for a fun girls’ day. Francois was there, as well, but it was the Pinault women who really stole the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Salma-Hayek-Daughter-Gucci-Show-MEGA-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Salma wore a bright blue dress with silver sequined print and a cutout detail at the chest. The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mexican-American actress</a> also wore a pair of gold high heels and big sunglasses, as she carried a silver clutch purse in her hand. Salma’s daughter and stepdaughter showed up to the event in outfits that were just as fabulous.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Valentina looked gorgeous in a blue button up shirt that she tucked into a leather black skirt. She also rocked tan Gucci socks and black platforms heels. She let her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wavy blonde hair</a> down for the Italy outing. Valentina <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>really resembled her gorgeous mother</a>, which has been happening more and more as the teen grows up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Last but not least, Mathilde — who is Francois’ daughter with his first wife,&nbsp;<strong>Dorothée Lepère </strong>— wore an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>off-the-shoulder black dress</a> with a pair of matching knee-high boots. The gorgeous brunette finished off her look with stylish black sunglasses. Mathilde is so tall that she towered over Salma and Valentina when the trio took photos together at the Gucci Show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Salma-Hayek-Daughter-Gucci-Show-MEGA-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Salma has taught her children a lot about fashion over the years, and clearly they’ve understood the assignment! Let’s not forget, Salma and Valentina <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>appeared on the cover</a> of Vogue&nbsp;Mexico together last year, showing the world how powerful of a duo they are. The mother and daughter wore&nbsp;matching Gucci logo looks, including a mix of prints and florals. And in the accompanying interview, Salma revealed that Valentina <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>has a knack for the famous star’s clothes</a>!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“We fight over clothes because she takes everything from my closet,” Salma told the outlet, adding, “since she was little she never let me choose her clothes, and I always liked that.” Salma gave birth to Valentina in 2007 when she was 41 years old. Through her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage to Francois</a>, Salma became a stepmother to his three children, including Mathilde. Salma has a close bond with all of her stepchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5FtZqyZnKKubrTAspykZZSWwqi0056pZqukmr2lrdSgn62domK0tq%2FComSmoZyWu26ywKyfoqeeYsSmscpmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
