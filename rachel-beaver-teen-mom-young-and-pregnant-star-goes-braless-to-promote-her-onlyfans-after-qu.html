To attract more followers for her X-rated profile, shared a series of mirror selfies with her 130k Instagram followers while flashing her underboob. In the post, she was seen wearing a blue skimpy romper that featured cut-outs underneath her bust.</p><p>Not just her outfit, Beaver’s overall look was also on point as she donned a full face of glam makeup with winged eyeliners. The kept her blonde tresses straight and open as she went on to put her butt on display in skin-tight clothes, attracting thousands of likes and numerous comments.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ</strong></p><p>A fan of her wrote, “YOU ARE SO PRETTY 🦋✨ love your confidence and love that you stay true to yourself.” Another fan hailing Beaver’s choices said, “Everyone hating on you for doing only fans when THOUSANDS OF OTHER FEMALES DO IT AS WELL. like what the hell . Literally everyone has an only fans nowadays. They’re only hating on you because you’re from teen mom. You’re a good mom providing for your child.” The third one noted, “SO GORGEOUS!!! ❤️”&nbsp;The fourth one commented, “Do your thang Girl!!! Haters gonna hate!!!❤️” “So beautiful I wanna call u mine 😍😍😍😍,” the fifth one added.</p><p>This comes after the news in August that Beaver had left the show. At the time, she reportedly , “My mental health is/will always be more important than money. Therefore I have decided to quit Teen Mom. This will be my last season and I appreciate the opportunity I have been given,” before adding, “It was fun while it lasted.”</p><p>Though now it’s known that Drew Brooks is the father of Beaver’s daughter named Hazelee Rae, this was not clear a few years ago. In 2019, she talked to (MEAWW), where she said, “I think a lot of people are going to see it and be like, 'oh, she doesn't know who her baby daddy is', and probably think that I run around and do stuff. But I don't know how people will feel about it.”</p><p>She had shared, “I know they are going to be mean about it, obviously because I am a 16-year-old who doesn't know who her baby daddy is but nothing could ever beat me up about that because I know that I really tried in my relationship. And I really put a lot of time into it and if people cannot see that then I guess that is on them.”</p><p>“I hope people see it and realize that I really tried and I messed up but I made something out of it. I hope people see that just because I don't know my baby daddy, that doesn't define me. That doesn't make me a bad person and it doesn't define who I am. I hope people see my story and get inspired by it and realize that they are not alone and see all the craziness that happens in my life and not only be entertained by it but learn something from it,” Beaver had said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpGYtaa4jJucmq6Vp3q1scSnZKannWLGsMHNoGSappRivbOxxqeYp6xdqMGivoygpp6rXZe%2ForjErKpmrJ9ivbO7zKirnmWYmr9uu82lsGaekaPA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
