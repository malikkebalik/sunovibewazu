Robyn left an indelible impression on anyone who met her because of the special bond she shared with the horses she adored. Those who met her will never forget her, and the void she leaves behind will be difficult to fill.</p><p>Robyn Cuffey’s unwavering dedication to the equestrian community and her boundless love for horses have left an indelible mark on the MSSPA and the people she assisted. Her memory will remain with us as a continual reminder of the importance of kindness, resiliency, and the profound connections that can be formed between people and the animals they love.</p><p>Robyn has touched the lives of innumerable horses, and it is with that awareness that we bid her farewell.
