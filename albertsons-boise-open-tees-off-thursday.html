Beyond the prize money however, Albertsons Boise Open executive director Jeff Sanders, advertises the tournament as "Golf-Chella."</p><p>"Golf-chella. Golf by day, music by night. Food, wine, music, golf, a spirit and a beer, all go together to form the six pillers of Golf-Chella, right here, this week at Hillcrest Country Club," Sanders said.</p><p>Several hundred people are already golfing, part of a Pro-AM tournament that began Wednesday afternoon. But for the pros, their main focus is the open which starts Thursday morning. A winning effort, guarantees a PGA Tour Card.</p><p>"It puts the spotlight on Boise," Sanders said of the tournament's importance. "It puts the spotlight on our golf tournament... this is an event that these guys, if you win it, you're in the PGA Tour."<br></p><p>Once the golf clubs go away for the night however, spectators have a whole lot more to look forward too. The Jonas Brothers performed earlier this week to a VIP crowd, but more than 10,000 people are expected at the open's concerts each night.</p><p>"We end Thursday night with Sheryl Crowe, Friday night with Joan Jett, and Saturday night with Weezer. So, entertainment is the name of the game here. Let's just entertain the fans, have some fun, but at the end of the day, the most important element of this is how much money goes to charity, and that's what it's all about, that's our scorecard," Sanders said.</p><p>Combined with the food options, bars and lounges, Sanders expects this to be the biggest crowd in the event's history.<a href=# title=https://www.albertsonsboiseopen.com/tickets.html class=themeColorForLinks> Tickets</a> are already sold out for every night except for Sunday, the final round of golf.<br></p><p>One important note, all ticket sales go to charity, of which you can select from a list of options.</p><p>The first tee off time is Thursday, August 24 at 7:05 a.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwrcubnKuso6S7tHnBqKCsnV2kvaa6jK2cnqtdpLOnedOhrKurlJbGbnyXZmltZWJlf3Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
