She relocated from Orange County to Los Angeles after graduating from high school.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_the_Meaning_of_the_Name_Sharise>What Is the Meaning of the Name Sharise?</span></h2><p>Although Ruddell, who is now 58 years old, has yet to explain how her name came to be Sharise or what it means, hypotheses include that it originates from the Anglo-French “Cherise,” which means “cherry a deep, bright red color tinted with pink.” The name means grace and love in Greek.<br>How old is she?</p><p>She is currently 58 years old.</p><h2><span id=Sharise_Ruddell8217s_Ex-Husband_Vince_Neil_Relationship>Sharise Ruddell’s Ex-Husband Vince Neil Relationship</span></h2><p>Neil and Sharise were married from 1987 to 1993. Ruddell first met the heavy metal musician at one of his house parties. On April 30, 1987, Sharise married Neil, a rockstar.</p><p>Sharise revealed her favorite aspect of Vince Neil when asked.</p><p>He was great, following me like a gentleman.</p><p>Ruddell and Neil went on their first date at L’Orangerie, a high-end restaurant in Beverly Hills.</p><p>Sharise claimed in an interview that she knew her and Neil’s relationship wasn’t going to work out before their wedding. She stated that as their relationship progressed, Vince got more alcoholic, and her reaction to this was</p><p>Oh no, I’m in big trouble.</p><p>Ruddell claimed that the biggest issue was how her ex-husband Vince handled disagreements. She claimed Neil was bad at problem solving and would toss and shatter objects in front of her. Vince, according to Sharise, once destroyed a glass table directly in front of her. Sharise stated that she could have received some fragments in her eyes. Following that, Sharise told Vince, “I’m not putting up with this.” When they split up, they were in Canada. Sharise also disclosed that Vince was unfaithful to her in one of the first season’s episodes.</p><p>Ruddell and Neil’s divorce was finalized in 1993. During a Q&A, Sharise disclosed that her divorce settlement from the Shout At The Devil singer was less than $100,000.</p><h2><span id=Sharise_and_her_ex-husband_had_a_daughter_named_Skylar>Sharise and her ex-husband had a daughter named Skylar.</span></h2><p>Sharise, 58, had a daughter, Skylar Lynnae Neil, with her ex-husband Neil, who died when she was four years old. Ruddell’s daughter, born on March 26, 1991, died on August 15, 1995, after a four-month battle with cancer. Skylar’s appendix was initially presumed to have ruptured, but it was later discovered to be Wilms’ tumor, a malignant tumor surrounding both of her kidneys.</p><p>Skylar, Ruddell and Vince’s only child, underwent six surgery, as well as severe chemotherapy and radiation. However, none of the surgeries were successful in saving Skylar’s life, and she died on August 15, 1995. Her parents laid her to rest in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Sharise once told Chatelaine that she “wore a hole in her sheets by just staying in her bed” after the death of her daughter Skylar. She added that spending time with friends and letting time pass were the things that helped her heart the most. Ruddell, on the other hand, stated that such a loss can never be forgotten.</p><h2><span id=Sharise_Ruddell_has_a_child_from_one_of_her_previous_marriages>Sharise Ruddell has a child from one of her previous marriages.</span></h2><p>Sharise began a relationship with Kirk Seigel, a fellow designer, when her marriage with Neil ended. On November 3, 2002, the couple became parents to Colt Seigel. Kirk and Ruddell, on the other hand, divorced in 2006. Colt, Sharise’s son, is a budding DJ.</p><p>Ruddell apparently had connections with a couple more men after Seigel, but she usually kept those details hidden. In the present, it has been reported that the former reality star is dating a man named Steve Kinninger.</p><p>According to reports, the two began dating in 2016. However, some sources claim the couple has already broken up.</p><p>Ruddell’s ex-husband, on the other side, is currently dating Rain Hannah. He has had multiple partners in the past, and from three of them, he has three children, including Skylar. Neil’s children are now Elizabeth Ashley Wharton and Neil Jason Wharton.

One of the most well-known is the late All Eyez On Me singer 2Pac Shakur. While it is unknown whether or not this fling occurred, Sharise did have a strong relationship with Shakur. She used to own the Changes singer’s California Love Hat. It was the same headwear that Shakur used while filming his music video for California Love. Sharise said in an interview that when Shakur handed her the hat, he had signed it and written his phone number on it. The headgear was later auctioned off.</p><p>Sharise was also suspected of having relationships with Taime Downe, the lead vocalist of Faster Pussycat, American actor Judd Nelson, and Kelly Nickels, among others.</p><p>Sharise also dated Brandon while she was a cast member on Ex-Wives of Rock. The relationship was also a plot point in the show.</p><h2><span id=Sharise_Ruddell8217s_Career_She_Was_A_Mud_Wrestler>Sharise Ruddell’s Career; She Was A Mud Wrestler</span></h2><p>Sharise worked as a mud wrestler at the Hollywood Tropicana before meeting Shout At The Devil vocalist Vince Neil. She later became a model and appeared in the music video for Motley Crue’s Girls Girls Girls.</p><p>Sharise later became interested in fashion design. As a designer, she has used her creativity to create stage coats and unique pieces for fashionable and high-end retailers on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Vince’s outfits were likewise designed by the blonde woman from California.</p><p>Sharise also used to own a company called NA-NA, however it only existed for a brief time. It did, however, develop popular styles such as Pink Polka Dot Kandy and Wrappers bikinis.</p><p>Sharise took some time off after her daughter, Skylar, died.</p><p>Ruddell, 58, currently owns Home Sweet Home Remodel and Design, which he founded in 2017. She is also a casting producer at Renegade83 LLC.</p><h2><span id=Is_Sharise8217s_ex-husband_Vince_Neil_as_wealthy_as_she_is_Their_monetary_worth>Is Sharise’s ex-husband Vince Neil as wealthy as she is? Their monetary worth</span></h2><p>Although Ruddell is well-known as an entrepreneur, fashion designer, and reality star, it appears unlikely that all of her responsibilities have earned her fortune comparable to her multimillionaire ex-husband, Neil, who has an estimated net worth of more than $50 million.</p><p>Furthermore, Neil’s celebrity far outweighs his ex-wife Ruddell’s, resulting in a disparity in their net worth. Nonetheless, because Ruddell is also a businessman with considerable clout, she may well be a millionaire on her own.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity ex wife</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Elizabeth Ashley Wharton | Truth of Vince Neil Daughter</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>All About Mauricio Lara | Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfqLWivsisnGaqpZmxprjLZq2ippOaeq%2BxyKWqZp2oYsSqssRmmKCdXZius7HEq2SrnZyWwaq7zayfoqijZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
