A bunch of the actress’s friends gushed over Jupiter’s photo on the comment section, including Blake Lively and Amanda Kloots. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>High School Musical director Kenny Ortega also dropped by, wishing Tisdale a happy mother’s day.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress also celebrated moms everywhere when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking</a> with Forbes recently, where she talked about her sister — a single mother for over a decade now.</p><p>They are my superheroes. Becoming a mom, you really don’t realize how hard it is. It’s amazing, it’s awesome, but it is definitely not the easiest thing in the world.</p><h2>Married To Christopher French Since 2014</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Tisdale and Christopher French, a music composer, met each other back in 2012. Eight months later, the duo got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engaged</a> on top of the Empire State Building. The couple tied the knot on September 8, 2014, in Santa Barbara, California. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Just a few days after celebrating their sixth marriage anniversary, Tisdale <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> her pregnancy by showing off her baby bump together with French on September 17, 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The couple was&nbsp;dressed in all-white, posing with lush greenery behind them.</p><h2>Love At First Sight</h2><p>In 2013, Tisdale revealed in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with On Air With Ryan Seacrest that she knew he was the one for her immediately. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I’ve obviously been in long relationships in the past. But I think because of knowing what I wanted, I wouldn’t have gone into a relationship if it wasn’t what I wanted. I think from the moment that him and I met, I just knew it.</p><p>French also produced Tisdale’s 2013 song, ‘You’re Always Here.' Tisdale said his involvement in the production process was one reason why she was sure of him as her&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;partner. French&nbsp;has collaborated with Tisdale musically on other projects besides the song, often <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearing</a> on her YouTube channel for her music sessions series.&nbsp;</p><p>The married couple has done covers of some of their favorite <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">songs</a> like Paramore’s ‘Still Into You’ and Walk The Moon’s ‘Shut Up and Dance.’&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKhdmMKtwNSrnGiZo525psWMraCsnJGhsm6%2Fx5qpnqtdm7azv9Nmp6GnpKTAbrvFZp%2Beql2WsbC%2BwJujnmWSlq%2B6ecaiqaVlmqq9qsDEq2WhrJ2h</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
