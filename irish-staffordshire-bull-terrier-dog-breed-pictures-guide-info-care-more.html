Once they spend their energy, they make incredible couch potatoes and tend to think they are lap dogs.</p><h3><span id=Training>Training 🎾</span></h3><p>As mentioned, this breed will require more experienced owners that have the time, patience, and knowledge to train them. Anyone training the Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier will need to be firm and willing to show the dog who is in charge. They are generally very eager to please and pick up on training surprisingly well. They do best with positive reinforcement, as they love knowing they’ve made their handler happy.</p><p>As with any training method, discipline and consistency are extremely important. Not only is it important to train your dog in typical obedience, but it’s also best to socialize them and train them how to interact with other animals and people. Starting your training around 8 weeks of age is ideal, or as soon as you can bring them home. Remember that you’ll need to dedicate yourself to training to <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>get a well-rounded and well-mannered family pet</a>.</p><h3><span id=Grooming>Grooming ✂️</span></h3><p>Irish Staffordshire Bull Terriers have <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>low-maintenance</a>, short, shiny coats. They will shed their coat so you can expect to find short hairs all over the house, especially during periods of high shedding, such as springtime. Occasional brushing will suffice and can help with loose hairs. This breed will do fine with occasional baths, but it won’t be a frequent requirement.</p><p>It’s a good idea to have your dog accustomed to getting its teeth brushed weekly and its nails trimmed every month. Many owners are apprehensive about trimming a dog’s nails but with proper tools and practice, it can be a very simple task. You’ll want to make sure you check your dog’s ears for any dirt or debris. It’s not uncommon for Irish Staffordshire Bull Terriers to get ear infections.</p><h3><span id=Health_and_Conditions>Health and Conditions 🏥</span></h3><p>The life expectancy of an Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier is typically 10–15 years with proper care and nutrition. This breed is vulnerable to allergies so it’s important to keep an eye on that. They can be prone to obesity, hip and elbow dysplasia, and knee problems.

It’s also very important to spay your female, as it can help prevent diseases, such as cancer as they get older. Females tend to be very motherly and protective with children. They also have a knack for picking up on your emotions.</p><p>Temperamentally, there is little difference between male and female Irish Staffordshire Bull Terriers other than the males may act more like bulldozers than the females. Males and females are typically easy to train, equally intelligent, and loving dogs.</p><h2><span id=i-2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></h2><h2><span id=3_Little-Known_Facts_About_the_Irish_Staffordshire_Bull_Terrier>3 Little-Known Facts About the Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier</span></h2><h3 class=num-head><span id=1_They_Are_Not_Recognized_By_The_Irish_Kennel_Club><span class=dhn>1.</span> They Are Not Recognized By The Irish Kennel Club</span></h3><p>There’s no mistaking the fact that the Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier is related to the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

This legislation outlawed dogfighting, bull-baiting, and even bear-baiting. They were not commonly kept as companion dogs until after this legislation passed. Their history as fighters made it difficult for the breed to gain recognition by the British Kennel Club but was eventually recognized in 1935.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=3_They_Are_Victims_of_Breed_Specific_Legislation_All_Over_the_World><span class=dhn>3.</span> They Are Victims of Breed Specific Legislation All Over the World</span></h3><p>Bully breeds of any origin are generally classified as Pit Bull-type dogs.
