Jenner has had quite the list of ladies in his life over the years. While some have been relationships that didn't manage to stand the test of time, others have reportedly been fun flings. When it comes to the latter, Jenner has been linked to quite a few stars, as reported by<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Ranker</a>.</p><p>Rumor has it that he had a one-night stand with Lindsay Lohan back in 2006. He then briefly dated Nicole Richie that year. He was also linked to Haylie Duff, the star of 'Napoleon Dynamite' and Hillary Duff's older sister. On New Year's Eve in 2007, he was spotted making out with Paris Hilton. Then came the whole allegedly romance with Lauren Conrad, the star of 'The Hills'. However, turns out there wasn't much to it, seeing that the two apparently never dated. It was a plotline for the show, at best.

But at the same time, we were friends, and we were happy to film together," she added.</p><p>While on 'The Hills,' he dated Playboy model Jayde Nicole. However, the two called it quits in 2009 after 15 months of dating. A more lasting relationship came in 2010 when he dated singer Avril Lavinge.
