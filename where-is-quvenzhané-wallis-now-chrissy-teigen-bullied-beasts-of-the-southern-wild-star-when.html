Chrissy Teigen bullied Beasts of the Southern Wild star when</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>American model, television personality, author, and entrepreneur Chrissy Teigen has come under fire for bullying people on social media in the past. Model Courtney Stodden earlier claimed that Teigen had privately messaged to tell them to kill themself. Now, many on social media are also demanding that she also apologize to actress Quvenzhané Wallis over mean tweets.</p><p>The tweet is reportedly from 2013 when then-9-year-old Wallis, who starred as Hushpuppy in ‘Beasts of the Southern Wild’, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the youngest actress ever to be nominated. The tweet that has since been deleted, called Wallis “cocky”.&nbsp; Teigen reportedly wrote on Twitter, “Is it okay to call a small child cocky? I am forced to like Quvenzhané Wallis because she's a child right? Okay fine.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/db4b8bb9-4ac6-4b74-ae15-53b17fc3845f.1202157273><p>Teigen apologized for her behavior with Stodden saying, “Not a lot of people are lucky enough to be held accountable for all their past bullshit in front of the entire world. I’m mortified and sad at who I used to be. I was an insecure, attention-seeking troll. I am ashamed and completely embarrassed at my behavior but that is nothing compared to how I made Courtney feel. I have worked so hard to give you guys joy and be beloved and the feeling of letting you down is nearly unbearable, truly. These were not my only mistakes and surely won’t be my last as hard as I try but god I will try!”&nbsp;</p><p>Teigen added, “I have tried to connect with Courtney privately but since I publicly fueled all this, I want to also publicly apologize. I’m so sorry, Courtney. I hope you can heal now knowing how deeply sorry I am. And I am so sorry I let you guys down. I will forever work on being better than I was 10 years ago, 1 year ago, 6 months ago.”</p><p>But many asked her to apologize for what she wrote about Wallis. "Apologize to Quvenzhané Wallis as well, writer Clarkisha Kent tweeted. "Additionally you're still a troll so you might not want to use that in the past tense. I hope this is the day you realize that some things come with their own punishment & that projecting your self-hate onto others isnt 'quirky.' Seek help."&nbsp;</p><p>Another Twitter user said: “Chrissy teigen is a real-life mean girl who has always found joy in being completely rude, dismissive & out-of-pocket towards literal minors (courtney stodden, quvenzhané wallis) towards children as a full-grown mother of 2 & then has the audacity to turn around & play the victim.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>is nothing compared to how I made Courtney feel.

Things like, ‘I can’t wait for you to die.’ And not only her, but Joy Behar had a field day with calling me a ‘slut.’ Courtney Love told me I was a ‘whore.’ People came out of the woodwork to beat up on a kid because she was in a situation that she shouldn’t have been in. There were a lot of celebrities acting like playground bullies. Some of the worst treatment I got was from women, and we’re not going to get anywhere if we keep holding each other back.”</p><h2 class=split>Where is Quvenzhané Wallis now?</h2><p>Now 17, Wallis played the titular character in the 2014 ‘Annie’ film alongside an ensemble cast that included Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Bobby Cannavale, and Cameron Diaz.&nbsp; The year before, she had appeared in ‘12 Years a Slave’. Her other film roles include ‘Fathers and Daughters’ and ‘Trolls’. Wallis also made a brief appearance on ‘Black-ish’ as Kyra.</p><p>Wallis is currently filming ‘Swagger’, a television show inspired by Kevin Durant's youth basketball playing experience on the AAU circuit. The series, set to premiere on Apple TV+, explores the world of “youth basketball, and the players, their families, and coaches who walk the fine line between dreams and ambition, and opportunism and corruption.” Wallis’s character on the show is called Crystal.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqaWrsq%2FGx5qlnmWnlrmttdJmqrCZl5yys3nCoamiq6OuerWxyKCcp2WTrq%2BmvoybrKWkqZ67qHmYZrCemaJivK2wjK2uoqykmr9ur8Cnmp6knJqx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
