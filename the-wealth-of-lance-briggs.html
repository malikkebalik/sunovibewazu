He later pursued a major in sociology at the University of Arizona and was part of the Arizona Wildcats football team, excelling as the team’s linebacker. Briggs was named first-team All-Pac-10 Conference twice and was honored as the team’s Defensive MVP during his senior year. His college career comprised 33 games, with impressive stats of 308 tackles, 10.5 sacks, 36 tackles for losses, 3 interceptions, 10 passes deflected, 5 forced fumbles and 4 fumble recoveries.</p><p>In the 2003 NFL Draft, Briggs was drafted by the Chicago Bears as the 68th overall pick. His outstanding performance in the subsequent year, making 126 tackles and as an alternative player for the Pro Bowl, set the stage for his rising profile within the NFL. Further success followed in the 2006 season, culminating in his selection for the 2007 Pro Bowl. However, a foot injury prevented his participation in the event that year.</p><p>Subsequent contract negotiations and re-signings with the Chicago Bears saw Briggs’ wealth grow significantly, including a six-year, $36 million contract in 2008. He was voted to seven consecutive Pro Bowls during his 12-year career with the Bears, a feat achieved by only the fourth linebacker in the franchise’s history. This period of success enhanced his global popularity and financial standing.</p><p>Beyond his professional career, Briggs has faced personal challenges involving legal disputes and controversies related to child support, with three children from three different women. On a philanthropic front, he established the non-profit organization Briggs4Kidz, with a focus on raising awareness and funds for underprivileged youth.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiroZ1drLKiuNOhZKieXaGur6%2FEZpmroZecwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
