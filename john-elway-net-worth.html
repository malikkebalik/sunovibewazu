Currently, Elway serves as the general manager of the Broncos, and in 2016 won his third Super Bowl with the franchise.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>So just how rich is John Elway? Celebrity dot money estimates that Elway’s net worth is over $160 million dollars, while his annual salary is as much as $3 million. Elway has accumulated most of his net worth during his career as a professional football player, exclusively with the Broncos from 1983 to 1998, plus several business interests.</span></p><h3>John Elway Net Worth $160 Million</h3><p>John’s father, Jack Elway, served as a high school head coach, and later became an assistant NFL coach, and worked at Montana and Washington State Universities. Elway’s childhood depended a lot on his father’s job, as the whole family had to move according to their father’s employment location. However, they spent most of the time in Montana, Washington, and in the San Fernando Valley, where John Elway attended the Granada Hills High School. In school, Elway became interested primarily in football and baseball, even taking part in the Major League Baseball Draft in 1979, and was chosen by the Kansas City Royals. On matriculating from high school, Elway continued his studies at Stanford University, where he had more opportunities to showcase his baseball skills. Once again he entered the MLB Draft in 1981, and was selected by the New York Yankees. However, when he graduated with a degree in economics, he decided to pursue a career in American Football instead, and upon entering the 1983 NFL Draft, was picked by the Baltimore Colts, who then traded him to the Denver Broncos. As a player, John Elway stayed with the Broncos until 1998, when he finished his professional football career, and then returned to the team in 2011 as an Executive Vice President of Football Operations.</p><p>From his first season, Elway proved himself to be a skillful football player. Over the years, John Elway managed to become a Super Bowl champion twice, in 1997 when the Broncos secured their first ever title, and again in ‘98, when he also became the oldest player – at 38 – to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl. He was an AFC champion five times, NFL MVP in 1987, UPI AFC Player of the Year two times, and was the Super Bowl MVP in 1998. He was selected nine times to the Pro Bowl, a Bronco’s record. At his retirement, he had recorded the most wins ever by a starting quarterback. Later John Elway was inducted into the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame, Colorado Sports Hall of Fame, as well as the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004.</p><p>In addition to being a professional football player, John Elway did not shy away from business opportunities. In 2002, he bought out a co-ownership of another American Football team, the Colorado Crush, remaining as such until the Arena Football League (AFL) was cancelled in 2008. Elway also owns several restaurants named “Elway’s”, which are located in Denver. To contribute to his wealth, Elway began endorsing LASIK eye surgery, and also became a spokesman for “OpenSports.com” website.</p><p>In his personal life, John was married to Janet Buchan from 1984 until 2003 – they have four children. He has been married to Paige Green since 2009.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=29.209431345354><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>John Elway</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$160 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 28, 1960</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Port Angeles, Washington, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>215 lbs (97.52 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>General Manager of the Denver Broncos, Executive vice president of football operations, American football player, Athlete</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Granada Hills High School, Stanford University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Paige Green (m. 2009), Janet Elway (m. 1984–2003)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Jack Elway, Jordan Elway, Juliana Elway, Jessica Elway</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Janet Elway, Jack Elway</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Jana Elway</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>John Albert Elway , John Albert Elway, Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/JohnElway</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/johnelway?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31578947368421><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/johnelway</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0255863</a></td></tr><tr readability=18><td>Awards</td><td>Super Bowl champion (50), Super Bowl champion (XXXII, XXXIII), Super Bowl MVP (XXXIII), NFL Most Valuable Player (1987), Pro Bowl (1986-1998, 9 times), First-team All-Pro (1987), Second-team All-Pro (1993, 1996), AFC Offensive Player of the Year (1987, 1993), Sammy Baugh Trophy (1982), Consensus All...</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nominations</td><td>NFL Draft: 1983 / Round: 1 / Pick: 1, NFL Man of the Year (1992), NFL passing yards leader (1993), NFL 1990s All-Decade Team, Denver Broncos Ring of Fame (2004), Pro Football Hall of Fame (2004), College Football Hall of Fame (2000)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Movies</td><td>NFL: Greatest Super Bowl Moments</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=2><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>On Art Modell moving the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, "It was actually a good thing for me because I was no longer the most hated person by the city of Cleveland."</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=47.415983606557><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Named Executive Vice President of Football Operations for the Denver Broncos.
