Her Net Worth?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>What does it take to be married to a legend? Cindy DeAngelis Grossman knows the answer. She is the first wife of Herschel Walker, one of the greatest football players of all time. But behind the fame and glory, there was a dark side to their relationship. Herschel Walker had a rare and severe mental condition that made him act like different people, sometimes violent and abusive. Cindy DeAngelis Grossman endured years of fear and pain until she finally decided to end their marriage. How did she survive the ordeal? How did she move on with her life and career? And where is she now, after more than 20 years since their divorce? In this article, we will reveal the hidden truth about Cindy DeAngelis Grossman, the ex-wife of Herschel Walker.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marriage and Divorce: What happened between Cindy DeAngelis Grossman and Herschel Walker?</h2><p>Cindy DeAngelis Grossman is the ex-wife of Herschel Walker, a former NFL player and a current Senate candidate in Georgia. They met in college and married in 1983 after Herschel won the Heisman Trophy as a college football player at the University of Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cindy-Grossman-and-ex-husband-Herschel-Walker.jpg><p>Grossman and Walker seemed to have a happy and successful marriage on the outside. They lived in a luxurious home in New Jersey and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. Walker was a star athlete who played for several NFL teams, including the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings. Grossman was a businesswoman who worked for Sara Lee Corporation.</p><p>However, behind closed doors, Grossman suffered from Walker’s erratic and abusive behavior. He would switch from one personality to another without warning, and sometimes he would not remember what he did or said. Reportedly, he threatened to kill Grossman and himself, and he even pointed a gun at her head once. This incident was featured in a brutal political ad by The Republican Accountability Project PAC, which showed archival footage of an interview Grossman did after the publication of Walker’s 2008 book, ”Breaking Free: My Life with Dissociative Identity Disorder.” In the clip, Grossman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p><p>“His eyes would become very evil … The guns and knives. I got into a few choking things with him. The first time he held the gun to my head, he held the gun to my temple and said he was gonna blow my brains out.”</p><p>Grossman tried to help Walker and save their marriage, but she realized that he needed professional help. She convinced him to see a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with D.I.D. Walker. Grossman filed for divorce in December 2001 citing irreconcilable differences. She also got custody of their son Christian Walker.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship with Herschel Walker After Divorce</h2><p>After the divorce, Grossman kept her personal life private and focused on her business career in Irving, Texas. She never revealed the identity of her new partner. Meanwhile, her ex-husband Walker became a political figure in Georgia, with the support of former President Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being divorced for more than two decades, the relationship between Grossman and Walker still attracts controversy and attention. This is especially true since Walker declared his candidacy for the Senate in Georgia. Walker&nbsp;ran against&nbsp;Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock&nbsp;in the&nbsp;November midterm elections. However, he failed to secure more than&nbsp;50%&nbsp;of the vote, forcing a&nbsp;runoff&nbsp;on&nbsp;Dec. 6. He lost the runoff to&nbsp;Warnock, who won a&nbsp;six-year term&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Senate.</p><p>Grossman has accused Walker of abusing and threatening her during and after their marriage. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said </a>that Walker would call her incessantly and tell her that he wanted to kill her and her boyfriend.&nbsp;She also said that Walker would choke her, hit her, and use guns and knives to intimidate her. Grossman said that she feared for her life and the safety of her family, and that she obtained a protective order against Walker in 2005.</p><p>Walker, on the other hand, has acknowledged that he had violent outbursts in the past, but he has blamed them on his dissociative identity disorder or DID. He said that he developed multiple personalities or “alters” to cope with stress and trauma, and that he suffered from memory loss as a symptom of DID. He also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that he considered his ex-wife to be his “best friend”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cindy DeAngelis Grossman and Herschel Walker Son</h2><p>During their conjugal life, Cindy DeAngelis Grossman and Herschel Walker waited 16 years to have their first and only child, Christian, who was born in 1999. After the divorce in 2002, Grossman got custody and raised Christian as a single mother in Dallas, Texas, where he attended the Episcopal School of Dallas. She supported his interests in cheerleading and football, and later encouraged him to pursue his education at UCLA. Christian is now a conservative influencer and a podcast host.</p><p>Grossman and Christian have a close bond, but they have a very different relationship with Walker. Grossman did not publicly comment on Herschel Walker’s campaign but she reportedly asked him not to run for office, along with other family members. She did not appear at any of his campaign events or rallies, unlike his current wife, Julie Blanchard, who married him in 2018.</p><p>Christian, on the other hand, has publicly denounced his father in several social media posts and videos. He accused him of lying about his past, being unfaithful to his mother, and having three other children from different women. He also slammed him for paying for an ex-girlfriend’s abortion in 2009, while running as an anti-abortion candidate.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Christian Walker railing against deadbeat dads, and Nick Cannon specifically, as “everything wrong” w/ America on TikTok five days ago</p><p>“Get home and raise your kids!
