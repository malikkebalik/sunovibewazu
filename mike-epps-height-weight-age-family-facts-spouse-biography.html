He had signed up an artist named Philthyphil, in 2006, to his label. However, there were concerns raised about the deal from various quarters as the artist had just been released from a 3-year prison sentence on drug-related charges. The deal, worth nearly USD 200k, was canceled in 2007 when that artist was charged with first-degree murder. It was also reported that he was the mastermind behind a drug distribution racket.</li><li>He was the ‘Super Bowl ambassador’ in his hometown of Indianapolis for the 2012 edition of the annual sports event.</li><li>In June 2014, he was accused of physically assaulting fellow stand-up comedian LaVar Walker just outside a comedy club. It was alleged that Mike and 2 of his bodyguards had hit LaVar in the face and kicked him repeatedly, smashed his phone, and crushed his glasses. This was reportedly an act of revenge for LaVar having made a parody video about Mike. The local police had then issued a warrant for Mike’s arrest.</li><li>During a stand-up show in 2017, he had brought a live kangaroo on to the stage. He had received severe backlash for the act, especially after it was noted that the animal was looking distressed and being held against its will. Mike had later issued an apology stating that his act was totally unscripted and that he had no ill intentions.</li><p>Featured Image by Mike Epps / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqagpJ1dmr2xv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
