Nothing matters but the agenda and your 4 yo is a pawn they are happy to mindflay,” said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conservative writer Peachy Keenan.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A video depicting a mustachioed Disneyland employee in a dress went viral on TikTok and Twitter. <span class=credit>kourtnifaber/TikTok</span></figure><p>Dave Rubin, the host of “The Rubin Report,” joked that the employee would be hired to work for the Biden administration by the end of the day.</p><p>“What’s particularly interesting about this is how intentional it is. This is a dude with a mustache in a dress. Not a ‘trans’ person. Think how many real girls want that job at Disney and they gave it to him for a reason…,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he added.</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brandon Morse</a>, an editor at Red State, tweeted: “May you never suffer the same destruction of your legacy that poor Walt has.”</p><p>“This is disgusting and wrong,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted Jenna Ellis</a>, a lawyer known for working under former President Donald Trump.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Disney ditched the “Fairy Godmother In Training” title in favor of “Fairy Godmother’s Apprentices” last year to promote inclusivity. <span class=credit>kourtnifaber/TikTok</span></figure><p>“I remember when the ‘Disney Look’ didn’t even let women wear certain nail polish colors. Now THIS?!”</p><p>The Mouse House’s Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutiques have forgone gender norms since last summer.</p><p>In an effort to encourage inclusivity and benefit cast members who don’t necessarily identify as female, Disney ditched the “Fairy Godmother in Training” title in favor of “Fair Godmother’s Apprentices.”</p><p>“This way, cast members that might not identify as female can still be part of the process to dress up & style the children without having to refer to themselves as a female Disney character,” <a href=#>the corporation said at the time.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Walt Disney Company is feuding with Florida Gov.
